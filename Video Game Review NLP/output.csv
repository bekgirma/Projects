3,resident-evil-4,Renaigse,"Jul 14, 2023",9,"Игра шикарная, отлично оптимизирована, при этом с хорошей графикой, для современной ААА индустрии два этих сочетания будто неисполнимы. Геймплей хорошо исполнен, особенно в первых двух основных локациях (деревня, замок). Остров же несколько сдал позиции по моему мнению, ибо резик превращается там в откровенный шутан, а как именно шутан игра работает так себе, в силу ограниченности патронов и самой механики прицеливания - стрельбы, игра банально медленная по своей сути (по сравнению с типичными шутерами), да и в целом этот отрезок не очень зашел. Однако деревня и замок играются отменно. Боссы в целом норм, но ничего особенного, только Краузер выделяется, с ним было интересно драться. Сюжет в целом окей, моментами интересно, но ничего головокружительного, в этой игре скорее геймплей на первом месте. Также стоит отметить разнообразность игры, тебе постоянно подкидывают новые ситуации и новых противников, заскучать от процесса здесь тяжело. В общем и целом, один из главных претендентов на игру года (на данный момент).",Positive

6,resident-evil-4,viniciussawate,"Jul  3, 2023",10,"Resident Evil 4 Remake is a spectacular reimagining of one of the most iconic games of all time. Capcom has managed to modernize the classic survival gameplay with a spectacular new look, incredible sound and even more refined level design than the original. Gameplay is fluid and enjoyable, with precise and responsive controls. The graphics are stunning, with high-quality textures, amazing character modeling, and atmospheric lighting that helps create a constant sense of tension and terror. The soundtrack is brilliant, combining classic elements from the original game with new tracks that add more depth and emotion to the overall experience. The game even brings new areas, characters and plot elements that keep fans of the franchise on the edge of their seats. Resident Evil 4 Remake is a triumph, a worthy tribute to the original game that managed to surpass it in many ways. Capcom has delivered an incredible experience that is worth playing for both longtime fans of the series and those discovering it now. Highly recommended.",Positive

12,resident-evil-4,belloeaitante,"Jun 28, 2023",10,"They managed to make a perfect remake. When they announced this game I was skeptical since RE4 is not that old and I did not think it needed a remake. Boy I was wrong... They improved every aspect of it. They also balanced the over the top action of the original with several old school horror segments and a darker atmosphere. Graphics are excellent and the same goes for the game-play. They added a few things to extend the duration, such as side missions and mini games. I love the Resident Evil franchise and I pretty much liked every entry, except for Resident Evil 6.

For longtime fans like me, it feels like a blast of nostalgia and a pleasant return to a classic that I thoroughly enjoyed. It feels fresh and modern but at its heart still retains the charm and qualities that made the original so great. It may not be a genre-defining hit as the one before but is still a fantastic experience that can be enjoyed by both die-hard fans of the original and newcomers to the series.

23,resident-evil-4,zNeverSleep,"Jun 21, 2023",9,"Playing a finished, polished, and amazing game in modern gaming is truly refreshing since we are used to playing trash nowadays. Resident Evil 4 feels like a natural evolution of RE2, something RE3 could not do. Here, the gameplay feels solid and versatile. Parrying, evading, and new shooting mechanics are essential to encourage players to be aggressive, but not reckless, since good ammo management is necessary to not find yourself in difficult situations. The guns are well-balanced, which naturally makes every build unique and personal. One example is the crossbow. I think most people don't like it but it helped me so much to save ammo. In hard encounters, I always had ammo cuz of it. Being precise is well rewarded here as well. The level design invites you to know the map pretty well so you can't get caught easily and search for the best positions to kill the enemies - that are varied, requiring you to use different weapons to be efficient. The story has the same level of quality. Characters are fun and being around them makes the game enjoyable. I loved Ashley's persona and, because of that, protecting her was not tedious. Quite the opposite. Leon and Ada had both shown a maturation from the last game, which was explored in this campaign. I loved Krauser either, for some reason. His end was amazing. Also, the mystery involving the place was an amazing tool to make us interested until the end. Cutscenes and acting were top level - and speaking in graphics... Man, playing a 2023 game at launch when it is optimized and has amazing graphics feels almost supernatural at this point. I only had frame drops in only 2 moments - and it was reasonable. Otherwise, the game ran amazingly on my Ryzen 1600 and RTX 2060. Ultra settings (except for textures) at 1080p 60fps. I simply love this engine. Also, since I played RE 2 and 3 recently, I can assure you that the graphics are way better. Thanks Devs for that. This game deserves our money. Hands down.",Positive
24,resident-evil-4,ryesku,"Jun 21, 2023",9,"Absolutely love this game. You can just tell how much love Capcom put into it and they stayed true to the original in so many ways. A lot of things did change, especially the castle, but they were all risks I really think paid off. They still gave Leon some funny lines, and many of them that weren't included they still referenced in the challenge names. The game was still very action-based like the original, yet had a more serious tone and some parts seemed a little scarier like RE's survival horror roots. I will definitely be replaying this game!!",Positive

The only big problems I had with this game were things like movement (tf is that wobbly movement tho) and some combat sequences, I literally don't understand why they made the combat areas so damn small and then spawned something like 55 enemies from which 4 had chainsaws or some **** like that, that is just frustrating, but when the combat worked it worked fine and was very fun.

30,resident-evil-4,Silent-Heal,"Jun 11, 2023",9,"Developers,1. Force you to collect resources and ammo and need to sell some nonsense to a merchant, is that a RPG?! The definition of difficulty is as follows: A. Collect ammo throughout the area. B. No need to collect ammo. But here, even on any difficulty, it is necessary to clear the locations. The special agent came to such a mission without ammo, he didn’t even take a sandwich, the game is 2023, are you joking ?!2. You are stressing the player too much. Always Fear that you will not pass the game, because they are closed in a barn, for example, with a bunch of enemies and no ammo. For what that pressure?!3. Damage is often received by the player not honestly. Some important features you notice towards the end of the game. Ashley doesn't run after Leon. They often caught her and I lost through no fault of my own. Is it hard to run after Leon? He runs so slowly like an old man. The first arrival in the village where the policeman is being burned, the game writes Fight off the enemies, that is, it lies to the player. It is impossible to fight them off, only to play for time until the bell rings. How many times do you have to try and replay through no fault of your own, just like that, because it is written fight back. Developers, do you hate players? Also study the term - meticulousness. This is different from the challenge. 4. The 7th and 8th parts are almost copies of this game.5. There is one recurring trait in Resident Evil games that turns me off - constantly looking for clues, keys and puzzles, especially the second part. Even Shadows of Rose has this problem.6. And it is not necessary to make games gloomy, because it's nice when the sun shines. Shadows of Rose has 80% DLC in the dark, castle, etc. *It has to be Action first and foremost, cinematic action. Not an RPG, not in the dark and not revolving around puzzles and running back and forth. For the quality - good optimization, fairy tale and for the good human qualities of the main characters which left pleasant emotions, I put 9 points out of 10. And for the action, where it was playful, and not annoying (meticulous). People, be honest.

34,resident-evil-4,AbrahFP,"Jun  5, 2023",6,"El original dejó el listón demasiado alto, y el remake no llega.-Lo mejor: mejora gráfica, las físicas, y que es más desafiante porque los enemigos son más numerosos, rápidos y agresivos. El buhonero también está mejor, han añadido algunas misiones opcionales que aportan contenido y están bien, y la galería de tiro está chulísima. En cuanto al escenario y la inmersión, la parte del pueblo casi hasta el final es la única que está mejorada.-Lo peor: no entiendo por qué destruir las cinemáticas épicas y tan características del original y convertirlas en esta basura. Literalmente el guion y la producción de las cinemáticas de 2005 se mean en las del Remake(solo había que dejarlas igual, mejorando los gráficos), pero no, mejor quitarle todo el interés a la trama y la personalidad a los personajes y convertirlo todo en una comedia con 0 de coherencia. A parte de esto, han eliminado zonas enteras y bosses del original sin introducir ningún boss nuevo a cambio. SPOILER ALERT: por ejemplo, el boss del tren de la isla, que era el más difícil y terrorífico del juego original, aquí desaparece sin dejar rastro, cuando era de las mejores partes de la isla....solo han dejado todas las zonas que son un call of duty. La banda sonora es pésima, en vez de utilizarla para crear miedo y tensión, hace todo lo contrario, impidiendo escuchar a los enemigos rezando y cosas por el estilo....lo que supone una bajada de terror enorme respecto al original con míticas escenas como el ""morir es vivir"" frente a un altar con una música muy tenue y tensa de fondo. La aparición de las hermanas Bella es de coña, la aparición del gigante épica del 4 matando a sus carceleros cambiada por un ""rompe la puerta y ale"" Básicamente TODAS las escenas y TODOS los momentos míticos del original han desaparecido. No lo suspendo porque la jugabilidad es buena y por los minijuegos que he comentado en los puntos a favor.",Average

Also, Ashley is also pretty, that's all I'm saying. Ok now for the rest of the game, this is a well-made game, I never played the 2005 Original so Resident Evil 4 is a first for me. In the past, I have played the RE2 and RE3 Remake and It seems Capcom is on a roll, however, I still have a few problems with this game. The problems:In-game problems (These can vary from gameplay to mechanics)External Game Problems(These are content and other features)Misc (Small little pick here and there.) So first In-game problems, Leon moves like an old man, I would have appreciated an actual dodge mechanic like the last of us part 2, the quick turn is the most useless feature ever, because sometimes you misclick and it ruins the flow of the game and you get hit for stupid reasons.Stealth in this game is also kind of pointless you can just run around in sections mostly and shoot away.Guns are like baby pellet guns, I played this game on Easy first, and with a fully upgraded pistol, I expect 1 maybe 2 bullets to kill an enemy when shooting them in the head on Easy. Instead, it's like this:*HeadshotThe enemy is stunned*Headshot again - 1 bulletEnemy still walking*Headshot again - 1 bulletOk Now he is dead, sike he is on the floor reviving*He wakes up*Shoots again - 1 bulletNothing happens*Shoots again - 1 bulletOk, now he is dead. In most cases, it's like that sometimes they drop after 2 or 3, the shotgun is the best weapon.Next is Ashley, It maybe would have been better for Ashley to help a bit, maybe allow her to stun some enemies and then run away and hide. Instead, it's like this, you look away for one second and Ashley is already being taken away. Next is external Problems, I'm going to say it Capcom, stop putting microtransactions in your games for a quick buck, and just sell games please, Adding the mercenaries update and some ticket pay-to-win mechanics is not a good practice. And of course the big D...Denuvo, I don't want some 3rd party DRM slowing this game down and potentially ruining the experience. I'm here to buy your game, not some 3rd party DRM that can tax my machine. Misc problems, it has to do with the changes of some scenes in the game, including when you play the game for the first time, We were also supposed to pen the game and hear RESIDENT EVIL FOUR, but that didn't happen, the moment was spoiled. And I believe in the game there were some character and scene changes, I'm unfamiliar with them But I will take them into account. Other than that, a really polished game, I never experienced any bugs or crashes and wasn't overly frustrated with the game mechanically, but I do think RE2 is still better than this game slightly. Graphics: 9/10, The use of Quixel Megascan assets is kinda cheating.Story: 8/10, Some things are not explained, and some things are dragged out for too long.Characters: 9/10, Nice characters, Ashley is Pretty, Leon is a Chad, and the others are fine.Gameplay: 6/10, It's playable, I expected some better use of mechanics, Quicktime events are not mechanics.Performance and Polish: 10/10, That's shiny.Scumbaggery(Oh what this? This is a new section where I can tell how much of a scumbag Publishers can be, 0 is for nothing 10 is for...well you know): so 8/10, Its a Remake with Microtransactions, and DRM to put it lightly. So overall what shall I bequeath thee, CAPCOM, I'm fighting between a 7 and a 8, I think its a 8/10, If you remove all those MTs, and DRM then +1, if you did some innovative mechanics and kept some scenes and features then +1, you'd have a perfect game, it doesn't have to be 100% of the original, it just needs to be really really close. Ok that's it, I know my reviews can be long but thanks for reading, and pick this game up on a quick sale when you get a chance.",Positive

Atmosferinden, korku öğelerine, vuruş hissinden düşman çeşitliliğine, bölüm ve harita tasarımından sanat tasarımına tam bir şaheser. Son Resident Evil oyunları da olmasa oynayacak korku oyunu yok valla. Hikayenin kendisi olmasa da ilerleyişi hoşuma gitti. Baş kötüden önce, onun müritlerini öldürüyoruz. Bazıları gerçekten ilginç karakterler. Bu boss savaşlarının birbirlerinden farklı hissettirdiğini söylemek gerek. Son boss savaşı daha iyi olabilirmiş ama. Düşmanın üstündeki hassas gözlere vurma olayını değiştirmesi lazım artık serinin. Serinin ilk oyunu, 5 ve 6'yı oynamadım. Bu oynadıklarım arasında aksiyonu en bol olanıydı. Üstümüze resmen düşman boca ediyor. Özellikle 2 remake ile aralarında dağlar kadar fark var bu bakımdan. İlk başta hafif hayal kırıklığı yaşatsa da bu aksiyonun da kendisine özgü bir çekiciliği var. İlk baştaki köyler beni biraz gerdi doğrusu. Harita tasarımı, her yerin birbiriyle bağlantısı souls oyunları seviyesinde neredeyse. Bir ara botla açık dünyaya bırakır gibi oldu ama iyi pek uzun sürmedi. Sonunda bu oyuna da parry mekaniği geldi. Elinizde sağlam bir bıçak varsa, uygun zamanlama ile saldırıyı geri sektirebiliyorsunuz. Bir RE oyunda parry göreceğim aklımın ucundan geçmezdi. Bazen kullanmayı unutsam da epey işe yarıyor ve kullanması keyifli.

Considering though how bad some games get ported over to pc (hogwarts legacy comes to mind) this is a pretty good release. It's a shame developers seem to neglect optimization for PC these days if that trend continues it'll be tough to keep committing to being a pc gamer rather than console. However, Res 4 is not completely broken it just requires lowering of some settings to resolve the crashing till a fix is pushed out. The game looks good but it shouldn't need 16GB of VRAM for max settings that's ridiculous cyberpunk looks 10x better than Res 4 and I can run that maxed out no problems.",Average

Что страшного в финале игры - вообще непонятно,Еще и цветовую гамму побоялись особо изменять, она, конечно, не настолько оранжево-унылая, как в оригинале, но самый первый уровень с синевато-мрачным визуалом был гораздо лучше, а потом всю игру опять оранжевая сероватость, также боссы меня совсем не впечатлили, как обычно в Резике - унылые серые дизайны, по геймплею средние, хотя бой на ножах с ""Краузером"", конечно, гениален. Крч ""Рокн-Ролла"" и кардинальных изменений от Ремейка не ждите, это - моя главная претензия.Из классных мелочей, что мне запомнилось: ""Пиратский"" тир - одна из самых кайфовых бонусных мини-игр, что я видел в играх, у торговца неплохая озвучка, тупые шутки Леона - это прям то, что надо, а также я обязан отметить ""повседневную"" куртка Леона из ""Deluxe"" издания, с ней прям персонаж чувствуется по-другому, за около 300р можно докупить отдельным длс, но такое нужно делать бесплатно, обладатели обычной версии же даже не узнают о нём.Технически Re:Engine далеко не некст-ген, местами в узких комнатках текстуры стен не отличить от PS1, и я ни разу не шучу, общая детализация объектов тоже оставляет желать лучше, поэтому также не пойму похвал графике от критиков, но, в целом, для игры с динамичными боями, приемлемо.Поиграть первые 5-7 часов стоит всем, но проходить полностью одну из лучших игр года, как не парадоксально, но я считаю, необязательно.p.s. Нельзя было сразу это выпустить пару лет назад, а не абсолютно ненужный рескин семёрки - Re:Village, который хуже во всём, но нет, Capcom же нужны все деньги мира. Подписывайтесь на Кураторство в Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/curator/37365104",Positive

82,resident-evil-4,Trunks252,"May  8, 2023",9,"While not quite a masterpiece like the original, this is still a great game. You can tell this was carefully crafted with the original in mind. Even the smallest details have mostly been preserved. The game may play differently, but it all comes together to give you the same feeling as playing RE4 again for the first time. The fact that this isn't terrible is some kind of miracle. What holds it back from a perfect score is that it often takes one step forward, one step back in it's design. For every improvement, there is a new negative aspect added along the way. For example, movement is now much less restrictive, yet it feels way more clunky and unresponsive compared to the original. Knives are overall improved, but the guns' crosshair bloom replaces laser sights for more RNG based shooting. Ashley is overall much improved character, but unfortunately her AI has been downgraded. Krauser has been improved with more backstory and dynamic with Leon, the tradeoff being that Saddler has lost all personality and charm. Same with Luis and Ada; Luis is better, but Ada is worse. I am pointing out these negatives to highlight why I still prefer the original. Yes, most of the good stuff has been preserved from the original, which is why I give it such a high score. I don't need to repeat why RE4 is so great as it's been said a million times already. I have had a great time with over 150 hours already. I just can't help but be a little disappointed that Capcom didn't try harder to actually improve what was already there, instead we get these little weird tradeoffs. I could go on and on, but ultimately the game is still great. Just....not quite the masterpiece the original was.",Positive

93,resident-evil-4,Hexstone,"May  2, 2023",9,"RE4 it's a pretty solid remake in terms of story-telling (characters like Ashley and Luis are much more involved in the story, as well as Leon's interactions with Ashley. Leon is more on par with his RE2 Remake version same as the story and the tone itself and the continuity: Leon mentioning how the Racoon City events affected him, him having his pistol from Kendo - a gun shop owner in RE2 (you can see written on it his name) and his knife from Marvin; and pacing (which RE3 Remake butchered). So it's not as bad as RE3 was regarding them and this game keeps almost the entire key moments of the original game intact, unlike 3 which cut half the game. The cut content are some traps and rooms in the Castle, the U-3 boss fight (which is likely to be in Separate Ways, since it's mentioned in the note files from the game), the laser room (which was more of a filler in the original most likely to promote the 2002 RE movie), the QTEs like the boulder runs, the gondola which you used it to reach to the warehouse has now been replaced with a Mendez chase sequence; Salazar's statue, which has been replaced with one that shoots fire. The Island has certain areas reworked either for better or for worse, that's subjective. The good parts are that the game has many details that weren't there in the original like- Leon holding his pistol in different stances, Ashley tiptoes around dead enemies, some bridges break if they get enough damage, Leon's breathing increasing depending on how much you are running and him rubbing his shoulder if you shoot with the rifle for too long, the Brute losing its control while on bridge, Leon using walls as support if he has low health, and his aim being affected by his health level, Leon and Ashley reacting to wind and rain, the flashbang won't affect Leon if he's wearing the sunglasses cosmetic. As well as references to the original concept of RE4, known as RE 3.5, such as his jacket, him holding the pistol and the flashlight in dark areas, and the deer head falling down. - Some sound effects are pretty good, the save theme captures the atmosphere of this remake like 2's one did. The parry, dodge and stealth add variety to the gameplay, but I can see why others won't like them. Also you won't be able to always use the stealth, being a method for gathering resources before a fight, and the knife has limited durability which can be expanded. The lake sequence is more explorable now and the shooting range got expanded with charms that you can unlock, one of them being a reference to the Striker glitch in the original, the Striker charm giving you a boost in speed like the glitch in the Gamecube version of the original. The rest of charms being models which they were in the original game which also have their original names, which I think it's a nice touch. The golden egg can be used against Salazar, taking a big amount of damage from him. The achievements have the name of some of the original's one-liners. Also the remake barely has any bugs or glitches unlike of few of other modern games. Overall it's a good game on its own, but it could have been better in art and cinematic direction: the boss transformations are pretty underwhelming when compared with the original, in other instances the game lacks the original's game charm. Also Ada's voice acting suffers from lack of direction. Salazar while being less present, he now always stands at a higher place than Leon showing his insecurity which is a nice story detail but he could have used more screen time.",Positive

Gameplay is fine, graphics are good and some of the fights are fun but that's it. Mediocre at best and I don't see how this can be called a ""masterpiece"". I think the term has lost its meaning or maybe because gaming has become too mainstream and for the most part petty that the moment a game hits the minimum, folks would scream masterpiece. I don't understand why capcom don't want to remake their games the way they did with the 1st remake which was the remastered/remade RE game that got released on Gamecube and later on ported to steam and next gen consoles. To this day, I still think that is the perfect remake of a classic and it even got rid of the need to bother and play the PS1 OG Resident Evil. They did a great job with 2 Remake though . I'm not going to talk about 3 Remake, it was horrible. Sadly, RE 4 remake didn't quite live up to the OG. Cut content as usual, removing a lot of personality from the game, removing many cheesy yet iconic lines making the game so bland . RE 4 was never about horror . That claustrophobic, puzzle solving and strategic horror-survival element ended with 3 . RE 4 was just a goofy, yet funny and lively b-movie like game full of action and character, you remove that aspect and you simply end up with a generic action game . I've read many reviews in here, and I don't believe this is trolling. You can clearly see people bringing many solid points on why they did not like the game. I give it a 5 because like I said it's an okay remake especially after the atrocity that we got not too long ago. After this remake, now I'm certain that capcom don't really care about the old fans anymore, and they're just making games for a completely new audience, and clearly, they don't even like the original games. I think maybe we, old RE fans, should move on and forget about this franchise For those who wanna play it, wait till the game gets cheaper.",Average

105,resident-evil-4,SHMitchell,"Apr 23, 2023",10,"In a world where video-games can live through decades of relevance and new player-bases thanks to porting and remakes, the selection of 'new games' in our day and age tends to feel a world of a lot different from it may have felt 10 to 15 years ago. So what makes this particular remake stand out, considering it's die-hard fan base, and 10 different ports to platforms, differing to its original, 2005 release? It is, as it stands, a remake with so many similarities to its original counterpart, that when you do encounter changes made in tone, gameplay, enemies and the overall difficulty, it is something that catches you by surprise, and lends a refreshing lens to your gameplay. As for the gameplay experience itself, it is definitely an immersive experience, to boot. When players have to make a decision between what weapons they will use, or choose in what way they want to divide their resources, all of these things add up, and put pressure on the player, which also builds this sense of immersion. This forced mechanic of putting you in a position where you must make strategic decisions in order to survive, is intense and polarising. The scarcity of food and ammunition and resources leaves a lot to be desired in the form of media such as a movie, as you don’t feel a personal connection or woe when the characters run out of said resources, whereas this gameplay does not let you forget that if you make these kinds of blunders, you will find punishment for it. Limited bullets make you value your resources more, which builds a new sense of tension and apprehension in the player, which builds upon the horror aspects of the game. A game without these mechanics is much more limited in that regard; as it does not have the same abilities to build trepidation and anxiety. The difference in your consumption of the media; for example, viewing a cut-scene or alternatively playing the game, gives you a different lease on the story, and how you feel about it.It’s all about the difference between passive action and active action, the difference in these interactions is what truly influences your immersion, and thus has you assign a different level of feelings upon it. Worth a play if you're a pre-existing fan, or a new one.",Positive

109,resident-evil-4,PluckyBrit79,"Apr 21, 2023",9,"As someone that never played the original game but have enjoyed all Resi games since 5 (yes I even enjoyed that) I found Resi 4 Remake to be an excellent game, at no point did it feel like an old game and to be honest it felt so current that many of the systems that it revolutionised I simply took for granted. The game has tension, good game play, a quirky if forgettable story and excellent modernised graphics that maintain the original games character. Survival horror remakes have got off to a very good start indeed! My only negative is that for me at least on a Scar 18 laptop which has an 19 13980k and laptop 4090 sometimes on boot up it would run terribly only to run happily on a complete quit and restart, in addition ultrawide is not supported in cut scenes, this makes no sense as they're in engine.

111,resident-evil-4,jaykisawesome,"Apr 20, 2023",9,"To start this off, I just don't understand the mass bad reception here on Metacritic. I'm HOOKED on this game so far, and on my third playthrough right now. I've seen mixed complaints about everything in this game, too easy, too hard, good controls, bad controls, good story, bad story, good performance, bad performance, crashing, but I've only had a positive experience with this game and did not have a single horrible thing to say about it so far. First, the difficulty is perfect in my opinion. Standard is the difficulty I chose to play during my first playthrough, and this difficulty is a perfect option for new and returning players alike to get back into the world of RE4. The game doesn't try to baby you, at least on Standard difficulty and above, but isn't trying to beat you to the ground difficulty wise. Even the professional difficulty is balanced enough, assuming you've taken the assumed steps to unlock extra perks by beating the game on easier difficulties, for example Ashley's unlockable knight armor costume that makes her invincible to all damage, and the cat ear accessory for Leon that gives all his weapons infinite ammo. The combat is great here, being both responsive and smooth. The addition of knife parries is also a welcome feature, adding just a bit more defense to combat. The story here is good, but I do prefer the OG when it comes to certain character interactions and overall tone of the game. For example, Leon and Salazar get so much less interaction in this game, whereas in the original, there are multiple instances of Leon and Salazar bickering back and forth over the intercom cutscenes. Also, they've gone down a more serious tone in this game, which I fully expected. It's not bad in any way, but the more b-movie cheesiness is definitely scaled back a bit, which was a bit of a disappointment to see. It's not all bad however, as Ashley and Luis have much more personality and in Luis's case, more screen time in this game. Characters overall are done very well in this game, and I wish Capcom would've gave Leon more time to interact with his foes. Performance wise, my game looked and ran great, with not a single crash during my 32 hours of gameplay so far. I have a modern pc, with a Ryzen 5600 and a 6650xt, so I'm not sure how this game is running on older and more dated pcs, but I personally had a smooth experience, running 100+ fps with the games recommended settings for my hardware. My one big complaint that I see most negative reviews cover are the DLC microtransactions available for purchase. If these items were just skins, I'd have zero issue with this, but in reality, they offer 2 UNIQUE guns for purchase, along with upgrade tickets that boost the stats of your guns for purchase. I honestly have no clue why they chose to offer these transactions, as most people will not even consider buying miniscule content for a 60 dollar game. Pacing wise, this game totally stomps out the OG RE4 in my opinion. This game is now a smooth and action packed experience, but still not afraid to slow things down once in awhile for character interaction and short breathers, while not cutting too much content. One notable cut they've made is to the U-3 boss in the remake, and honestly I think this cut was for the best, pacing wise. The U-3 boss in the OG is fun, but feels somewhat out of place and random. I've seen the rumors that the U-3 boss will be in the also rumored, but basically confirmed, Separate Ways DLC coming out soon, and I think that U-3 will fit much better in the context of a separate and differing playthrough of the game. Besides the rather scummy and out of the blue business practice that Capcom has shoved into this game, I don't have any major complaints. I highly recommend this title to new players and returning lovers of the original alike.",Positive

I don't understand the amount of hate on the game, because it's a masterpiece, RE4 Remake did the impossible, surpassing the masterpiece that was the Original RE4. I know that many will not agree with this statement, mainly due to the nostalgia factor that prevents them from removing the blindfold of subjectivity, but RE4 Remake is superior in all sections without a doubt, graphically, in sound, in gameplay, in development of characters etc... There are some rat kids that are upset because they didn't include the additional content of the original RE4 like Separate Ways or because they included the microtransactions... Dude, those microtransactions are not mandatory, you buy them if you want, if not, you don't need to buy them, no I understand why so much whining on this subject. On the other hand, the DLCs will be available soon as well. In conclusion, my advice is not to be influenced by the bad Metacritic reviews, surely many of those people did not play the game, RE4 Remake will not disappoint you, he did a masterful job, if anything the only thing I did not like was that Leon It moves a little slow, but that adds an extra tension factor that comes in handy for gameplay. 10/10 Capcom broke it again.",Positive
118,resident-evil-4,jsmithe,"Apr 16, 2023",7,"First of all, this is not a 10/10 game.  The critics lied and it is more like an 8/10 at best.  The game is good overall but it has some issues.  Having just beat it on Standard and everyone already knowing the pros I will list some of the cons:- The game is too hard even on Standard and is ridiculous and downright sadistic on a clean playthrough on Hardcore and Pro.  Standard is probably 30% harder than the OG on Pro which is dumb for what is supposed to be a normal difficulty level.  The OG had an almost perfectly balanced difficulty on Normal when it came out in 2005.  As of this writing which is over a month after the game came out, only 49% of PC players have beaten the game on Standard according to Steam statistics and that is because the game is too hard with less than 30% having beat it on Hardcore and some portion of that 30% includes new game plus players using end game weapons.  99% of players didn't want to play a Souls game.- As so many others have reported the new RNG aiming system is ridiculous.  This does improve dramatically once you can put the laser sight on a few of the pistols but of course they then limit the sight to a couple of handguns only for ""balancing reasons.""  Literally all of the OG fans who played it in 2005 just wanted the Red9 or Blacktail with the laser again and they made the dumb decision to remove that.  Sniper rifle accuracy even when the high magnification scope is also janky and too hard to land headshots.  It's not a ""skill issue,"" it's just a poor implementation.  Aiming becomes much better with a mouse vs controller but still is janky and most don't want to play with mouse keyboard these days even on PC.- The shooting range is almost impossible to perfectly S rank using controllers even with the deadzones adjusted and still too hard even using a mouse due to the RNG aiming system.  No one wanted to sink hours into each range just to S rank them all.  A month out from the game's release and only 26% of PC players have S ranked them all and that doesn't mean a perfect S rank which proves that the range is poorly designed and too hard.- Ammo is too scarce to the point that even if you play well you're lucky to have 12 shotgun shells and 10 sniper rounds at any given time.  RE4 is supposed to be action horror not some old school RE survival horror-action horror hybrid and the game's enjoyment suffers as a result.  The OG would let you stock up a decent amount but not a ridiculous amount either as a reward for having good accuracy which was much more fun overall.- Headshots not always staggering enemies was a dumb design decision that ruins the crowd management aspect of the OG.  Granted using the laser sight seems to cause most of the enemies pre-island to always stagger but it's dumb you need the laser sight for that considering you are then forced to use the starting handgun or the punisher for the entire game which are early game weapons with low maximum damage.- The knife parry mechanic is bugged and randomly doesn't work 10% to 20% of the time.  I would reload the same save multiple times near a single low level ganado, let them swing a hatchet and try everything from spamming the parry / knife ready button to watching for the perfect parry prompt and one time out of five on average no parry would be performed and I would take damage. This while playing the game with a perfect high framerate.- The stupid grab move that so many of the enemies spam is ridiculous because you can't parry it and trying to duck it only works half the time at best.- No bonus weapons with infinite ammo after beating the game on Standard is ridiculous and then forcing the player to speed run the game on professional to unlock even the Chicago sweeper is even more ridiculous.  Capcom did this primarily to force people to buy the inevitable $5 DLC unlock pack that they eventually offered for the RE2 remake.  The other reason was to appease the Twitch influencer speed run loving cheeto beard crowd who have ruined gaming with their willingness to play through the same game twenty times to unlock anything.  The OG gave you the sweeper after beating standard which is what they should've done here especially after RE8 (Village) unlocked the infinite Dragoon assault rifle after beating it on Standard.- The Extra Content Shop sucks in general compared to RE8 with a bunch of cosmetic only costumes and even the infinite ammo weapons and so on only require a few thousand points to unlock.  The result is that on a first playthrough you work hard to earn challenge points for ends up being nothing compared to RE8.- The game has optimization issues that result in a lower framerate then it should have.- The Ada Wong voice actor is beyond terrible and it's clear she put forth zero effort into the job.- Cut OG dialogue and a more serious tone that doesn't fit the setting don't mesh wellI had way more to say but I hit the review character limit.",Average

It's kind of fun for the first 2 hours of the game or so, it just becomes point, mash buttons and run around after that. The puzzles are uninspired to say the least, either too simple or just stupidly obtuse. Compare this to a similar modern title like shadow of the tomb raider and it just becomes silly. There are some truly unique experiences to be had, I won't spoil them in this review. It's really linear , though you can go back and do things you missed, especially in the partner mode. I got through chapter 14 and just couldn't finish it, it just became more of the same old annoying so I just put it down, maybe one day i'll go back and complete....but probably not..i just don't care what happens. The voice acting, especially the supporting characters is kinda mediocre. The story is old rewashed hero's journey....maybe that worked at the first release but it doesn't now, This definitely isn't a 60 dollar title...maybe 20 bucks.

130,resident-evil-4,Lynxes,"Apr 10, 2023",0,"Not worth it. The game looks good, but hey it's 2023 and it's RE Engine, that much had to be expected, it also runs great! On an overclocked 4090 that is! The game is horribly unstable, crashes all the time, I had to replay the same parts multiple times because of the game crashing not near a type writer or a checkpoint, it may crash every 10minutes or every 2 hours, but it's a pain. The censorship was really unnecessary. It's a girl in a skirt and a couple jokes, just because a couple of people from twitter find them offensive now we gotta play a censored version of the game? We really need to dress Ashley more? What, are we back in 1800 where women couldn't show any skin or something? It's a videogame, not real life, and she doesn't even exist, so just leave her the way she was in the original, because yes those jokes and situations (that have been removed in the remake) where funny and gave the game part of it's personality, removing them makes the whole thing a bit more shallow. The lack of DLSS is the icing on the cake, I get it that the game is sponsored by AMD, but FSR sucks quality wise, it's looks like literal garbage. Even the little preview image in the settings where you have the toggle shows you an incredibly blurry image.There is a DLSS mod even though I had no luck with it, welp, thankfully I have a 4090, but if you don't do know that you can't enjoy max quality with DLSS thanks to AMD. Overall pretty disappointing, it's a watered down and more boring with less personality version of Resident Evil 4 with pretty graphics that crashes a lot of times.Don't buy this, and don't buy stuff that has been filtered by the Twitter Politically Correct Police, I did and regretted it. Update:A note that I have to add about voice acting.In my opinion almost everyone did a good job, but Ada was really subpar, Ada has a specific personality and her lines are meant to be read and played in a specific way, Lily Gao fails in doing this.Ada sounds bored, and rather than sounding like Ada it seems like she's trying to be Aloy from Forbidden West or any other generic wannabe bad female character, it's boring, repetitive, doesn't fit the character and quite frankly throws you off the immersion. Also, ignore those who discard negative reviews as **** trolls"", no, those are legit complaints.

143,resident-evil-4,gameplay_first,"Apr  7, 2023",6,"The most important aspect of any game is how it controls.More important than gameplay, graphics or lore.And this game simply does not control good in any way. I don't know what they were thinking.The original Resident Evil 4 was more of an action adventure.Maybe they wanted to go further into the direction of survival horror and made the controls that tedious on purpose, or they just wanted to recycle the code of RE2 remake, but they really have overdone it. Your character has so much movement based inertia now, that he feels as if he is constantly walking on ice. Every single input has a weird delay to it. You can't turn on a dime anymore and if you stop moving your analog stick, your character keeps going for a short time. It just feels wrong, even for a survival horror game. In this game they screwed up every single aspect of movement: + The camera is constantly so close to your character that it really feels nauseating, even for people who are not prone to motion sickness. And if you aim down sight it zooms in even more, to a point where it gets almost completely impractical. + Every single animation, including aiming down sight, takes forever to perform, with really long drawn out animations. + Your last resort weapon, the knife , has durability now and often breaks, so that it gets unusable on a regular base. Nobody asked for that change. Just like nobody asked for them replacing the laser pointer on your starter weapon with a very view obstructing widespread cross-hair. + Oh and headshots and ankle shots do not reliably stagger anymore.Out of some weird reason they randomized the amount of shots you need to stagger enemies now, which is really bad for no hit runs and general playing in higher difficulties. The whole game is just super unresponsive to control overall.Your character just simply never does what you want him to do and constantly lags half a second behind. Almost as if you would stream the game in the cloud from halfway across the world. +They also cut a lot of content, including some locations and a boss fight, probably just to resell them as DLC. + And the english voice acting is really bad. The game also completely lost its campy nature and humor and has a much more serious tone now, which is really unfitting for how ridiculous the setting is. Conclusion: They put a lot of effort into the game.Mostly into the presentation.But the things which really matter like controls, camera, faithfulness to the original, do the gameplay mechanics work and make sense, are all handled significantly worse than in the original game. If the controls were better, than it would be a 7-8/10 type of game.In its current state, it is a 6/10. There are mods available to fix many of the issues (no further zoom in on ads, larger FOV, unbreakable knife, reliable stagger on headshot, laser pointer on base pistol, no yellow paint on interactables, patching the obnoxious rain effects out of the game, no more constant grunting and out of breath sounds from Leon and Ashley) but mods cant fix everything. Up to this point there is no mod to patch the sluggish controls due to the movement based inertia  and the cut content does also not come back with mods. Maybe the cut content is buyable via dlc later on. Its probably smart to wait 6-12 month until mods fix the movement and then buy the game plus dlc for 30 dollar in total. But even then the original seems just a better game overall, level design and gameplaywise, if you can handle the rustic look.",Average

This is a Frankensteinian mix of og RE4's action gameplay, and the survival horror of RE7-8. If you enjoyed RE4 (2005), play this one on Standard difficulty, and never touch the other difficulties. Hardcore is already much harder than Pro on OG RE4, and Professional is stupid I think. If you play Professional and think it's fun, all power to you. You do you. Capcom obviously hit the mark then. But I can't for the life of me find any enjoyment in it, and I was also already highly frustrated by my Hardcore run that I did finish. I love hard games, but this type of frustration and over-reliance on the awful parry mechanic is not my cup of tea. Apparently parrying is a thing now in many AAA-games? I couldn't tell. I usually avoid AAA games like the (las) plagas. Regardless, Capcom should've been the bigger person and just not put that junk in the game.

147,resident-evil-4,Illuminous,"Apr  5, 2023",3,"I'll start off by saying that I've played all of the main entries into the residen evil franchise since they were released and I was devastated when I played the old RE4 (2005) when it was first released as it changed so drastically from a zombie survival game to a corridor-shooter without any care for creating a realistic environment. With that said, several years later with my disapointment sated I did replay the game and would score it higher than I did when first playing it. The remake of this game feels dated with the same corridor-shooting that worked perhaps 2005 but is far outdated today. The characters are bland and boring and the game is far too long for a game where almost nothing happens. The enemies are bland and boring except for a few encounters and the environments are not realistic at all. I fell in love with the RE2 remake since it took a concept and added a new layer to the police station that made it feel new yet the same. This game has none of that feeling. The only reason why it scores a 3 is because of the replayability and some of the changes made to the game compared to the 2005 version such as the removing of the most cringey coment and edgelord Leon moments. Still, can't recommend it as a Old-School RE fan as it brings much of the same that came to ruin the Survival Horror aspects of the franchise and gave us the more ridicoulus games that are RE5 and RE6. If you, however, enjoyed the 2005 version when it came out for its less focus on survival horror and more action-oriented approach I do think this game will be a 8-9 for you.",Negative

156,resident-evil-4,TheresNoDoubt,"Apr  4, 2023",4,"Terrible art style, terrible characters models, bad graphics. Remember when Capcom used to have new games with massive graphics improvement? From RE2 to RE3 in the 90s, to 5 years later RE4 a game that was on a league of its own when it comes to RE games graphics and looked better than most games in its generation, and then doing it again with RE5 who looked better in every area than the RE games that came before. Now Capcom is trash when it comes to that, there's barely any difference from RE2 to RE4 remake, on top of that these new games have terrible art style like I said which makes things even worse, you can barely see anything in certain locations, and of course its because Capcom doesn't want us to look at the terrible RE Engine textures, extremely lazy. Leon and Ada are the same trash models from RE2. Original RE4 and RE6 Leon and Ada models are SO MUCH better. Remember when Capcom kept making new models for every new RE game but no one cared because they were all amazing? It's a good thing to have the same models returning but only when they are good, the thing is that Leon and Ada from RE2 are trash. Luis and Wesker models are trash too. They took everything that made those characters cool. The voice of acting of those characters are also terrible. RE voice acting was great in the late 2000s, back when every character looked and sounded memorable. What happened? We know using the same things again isn't a issue for Capcom, as they have been using many of the assets they created for RE7 in every single new RE game, and that's why the new RE games look so cheap. So why not use the same voice actors from the past? Those cheap **** are trying to save as much money as possible, no wonder most of the new RE games are mostly just a copy and paste. Same trash art style for every single new RE game, same trash character models, same assets for 4 games in a row. But they can't bring back the voices that made those characters popular, no, that's too much for them. Maybe they are trying to save money with that too, and it's less expensive to bring new people to do the voice acting, who knows. But of course dudes are giving 10 to this trash, because they don't understand gaming. This is just the new generation, the same dogs who think Fortnite is good, they don't know when a game is actually good because they haven't played any. Gun sounds are terrible. Amount of cut content are terrible. Leon movement animations are terrible. Leon in the original was extremely stylish like Dante, literally every single animation of Leon was created to make him as stylish and cool as possible, which suited his personality very well. Now Leon personality is changed to worse, and theres literally 0 stylish things about him, even the spinning kick looks dumb as **** but his movement is just the worst. This game is going to be hyped for about 2 months and then everyone is going to forget about it, it will never be a classic that people kept playing for 20 years like the original.",Negative

189,resident-evil-4,erencetinkaya,"Apr  1, 2023",8,"I want to start off by saying how much I enjoy the game. And, in my opinion, it's a good remake of the original.I had a great time, especially at the Village arc. And the Castle was also a lot of fun to play. The Island, though, is a very tiring arc, so many enemies, so much action. That wasn't as fun as the village arc.Parry with knife is a fantastic new update that you'll undoubtedly use throughout the game. Organizing inventory is a lot of fun.There are sufficient resources and guns are good. With SG-09 R Handgun, I mostly used the Riot Shotgun and TMP. It's fun to upgrading weapons and making money.And Ashley, what a burden she is xd. However, she becomes useful near the end, i'll give her that.And then there is Luis, aka Don Quixote. I love that he is getting more screen time. He is, after all, a important character in the RE universe.  He worked at ""Umbrella Europe Laboratory Six"" as a researcher.Which the lab that responsible for overseeing the Nemesis Project. (RE3)His new death scene, which is better than the previous one, has my approval.  I'm hoping to see his past in other games or remakes. At Standard difficulty, it wasn't challenging for me to play.The bosses weren't too difficult to kill, and puzzles were simple. The environment and graphics are fantastic and feel very real. The atmosphere is thrilling but not too frightening.And i must say that i loved the Shooting Range.I'll surely return to this game. Now I have a complaint about the redesign of Leon's character.Leon was certainly not a figure like the in this remake when CAPCOM originally created the 2005 version game.He tells poor jokes, makes useless comments about events etc. New Leon's lack of experience is so clear. He's acting different. This new 'Leon' is nothing like the 2005 version of himself.Additionally, his new face from RE2 Remake simply does not suit Leon. I hated his new character overhaul.Leon the gothic, self-assured soldier was fine, suited him well. I wish he stayed like that.",Positive

They made remake much more realistic and just underlined every good aspect from original game, and it feels completely new to just play this story again. It took me 20 hours to complete this game on Hardcore for the first try. Definitely going to play once more on NG+. Soundtrack is amazing, feels refreshed after original ""Resident Evil 4"" 2005. Of course, nothing will replace original ""Serenity"" OST but still, feels good, man. Story changed a bit, and some timelines were swapped for better experience in my opinion. Played on RX 570, and never had any stutters, any missing textures. Just one bug with lighting, but I fixed it just by changing one option.

203,resident-evil-4,Sholva,"Mar 31, 2023",10,"They did it, again, and they did it right. This 2023 is becoming the year of the perfect remakes, first we had Dead Space, and now Capcom shows us how it’s done too, with RE 4 here. I can firmly say that this is an absolutely incredible game, there’s so much love and care poured into this remake that it makes it quite possibly one of the best Resident Evil games out there, it is…it’s just that good. Let’s talk Performance first, on my Ryzen 5 3600 and RTX 3060 Ti, the game runs quite decently at 1620p DLDSR with Interlaced rendering, easily above 60 FPS most of the time, no problem.The thing with RE Engine games that’s still not there yet is TAA and Temporal Upscalers, we got FSR 2 for this game, for the first time ever on a RE Engine game, but its visual quality and temporal stabilization is not great at all with its current implementation, so I had to settle for Interlaced to get some performance back.Hopefully Capcom improves this, whether by updating FSR 2 to a newer version, or also adding DLSS, I think they should do both, honestly. The main issue with the Graphics Settings though is Ray Tracing, as it can make certain setups crash if they’re lacking enough VRAM, instead of just slowing down. That is something they should try improving, and also the overall quality of this Ray Tracing implementation, which kind of leaves a bit to be desired, honestly. Moving on to Sound Design, well this game really sounds amazing, most of the tracks are quite epic and very cleverly selected for each moment, we have some of the OG ones coming back but re-arranged and changed a bit, the Shooting Gallery has not right having such a cool song haha, and so on…they did good here.Environmental sounds are also pretty good and on point, everything on the Sound department I think it’s great here. Character Models are some of the best I’ve seen in any RE Engine game, they have leveled up once again the quality. The new  technology looks insanely good, especially in cutscenes, where some of the characters look straight up as if they were CGI. Graphics, overall in this game, are incredible, some of the set pieces are astounding, and I could not stop taking my time and take so many screenshots with the included Photo Mode. Controls are pretty good on PC, with Mouse and Keyboard, just like the previous games, this one plays exceptionally well, with no major issues.It’s a shame that the Gyro Aiming controls are so poorly implemented natively, with barely any control over things like sensitivity or the lack or options to make the right stick do quick flicks, which is the preferred way to use Gyro Aiming, among other things that simply are missing here. Story is very much a huge improvement over the original game’s, for sure, and the scripts for the characters are much better written overall.Leon and Ashley now have pretty good chemistry together, with a lot more idle chatter and very cool moments. Luis really shined in this game too, they gave him a lot more stuff to do and much better background story. Ada remains as mysterious, cold and distant as ever, because in this game she can actually be her true self instead of trying to fool Leon, like she did in RE 2 Remake. Both Leon and Ada have grown a lot since then, and this game clearly shows this in all of their interactions. Continuing to talk about characters would get quite spoiler’ish, so I’ll leave it at that: good job to all of the actors, I loved all of their performances. All in all, this game is a blast to play, another example of how to properly remake a classic video game, and it clearly shows how much Capcom have learnt about working with RE Engine, and I can’t wait to see what future games this engine brings us, even beyond Resident Evil games.",Positive

216,resident-evil-4,Cyn3,"Mar 31, 2023",4,"With the original Resident Evil 4 the team set out to make something new and allowed the game to take the shape it wanted to, they caught lightning in a bottle and history was made. Why Capcom thought they could do this twice is beyond me. Pros: -The combat actually feels good, the impact from your physical attacks respond well to the environment- I like how they improved the Gigante fight by having the dog do more doing the fight. He even stays after the fight so you can thank him personally. The goodest boi!- Luis is a more long term coop buddy allowing you to form a stronger bond with him- The Merchant- The improved shooting gallery- The Donkey Kong Mine cart section is way more fun- They expand on Krauser and Luis' backstories, for the better in my opinion. Cons: - U3 Boss fight from the original was cut- Remember when they removed all the jokes pertaining to Ashley's body and anything that remotely seemed like flirting from RE4VR? Well they did the same thing here and replaced them all with awful MCU quips, as is the style of the time.- Speaking of Ashley, Capcom is well aware of the public perception of the original Ashley and as a result they have over corrected to the point where the game tries to trick you in to thinking she's more useful by constantly having her spout dialogue like ""We're a team! Right Leon?"". Yes Capcom, we get it, we can't have a damsel in distress in stories anymore! If you looked anymore insecure I would think you didn't actually care and you wanted to increase your ESG score! (Fyi there was nothing wrong with Ashley in the original, you were just bad at the game!)- The voice acting is serviceable in most places but the voices for Krauser and Ada can't be described as anything else than terrible. Whoever was in charge of casting should be fired because I don't know how a blunder like that got past the radar.- The Castle while still present was shortened significantly from the original.-  Separate Ways is paid DLC-- WHAT- Mercenaries not available at launch. Supposed to be a free update and I'm hoping against hope it's not a live service trap. (Hah!)- PC version has Denuvo In conclusion, game's not bad but it's not the new masterpiece critics and certain fans say it is. A good remake keeps the foundation of what made the original good and adds on to it, this is not what I see here. As I mentioned before the original was something new and it took the form it wanted to take, this one while it does some things better is also being held back by cutting out content and adhering to modern sensibilities to the point where it's embarrassed to be associated with the cheesiness and B movie fun of the original. If you really want to check this out and you haven't played the original yet I highly recommend playing the original first, it still holds up, it's on sale all the time and the HD project mod breathes new life in to the game that is so good it honestly makes this remake irrelevant. There really is no reason for this game to exist when we could have gotten a remake of Code Veronica instead.",Negative

230,resident-evil-4,Sammydex,"Mar 30, 2023",10,"Gameplay e mecânicas:Mecânicas. Defender com a faca, quick time events reduzidos, personalizar tesouros, deixar Ashley mais afastada ou próxima, dentre outras mudança/reformulações. Estam perfeitas e fazem mais sentido do que o original.Gameplay. A fluidez das animações, comunicação entre os personagens, agrecividade dos inimigos, as batalhas dos bosses, animações de morte etc. Se encaixam muito bem ao game, e é notavel a melhoria em todos esses aspectos, pois existem detalhes que te fazem lembrar o original, dando uma sensação de nostalgia.De maneira geral eu amei as novas mecânicas e o estilo da gameplay. Eles deixam o jogo mais diversificado, te dá novas possibilidades e maneiras de enfreitar os inimigos, aqui o jogo nos permite usar a criatividade em diversos momento .Historia do jogoA história do jogo foi levemente alterada, digo que o termo ""reformulada"" se encaixa muito bem, pois ela mantém a essência do original, e acrescenta alguns pontos que não foram abordados ou mostrados no RE4 original. Isso é muito interessante, deixa o jogo mais imersivo, parece que aquilo era para acontecer ali e ser ali. Os documentos, alguns elementos, acontecimentos, inimigos que você enfrenta. Isso tudo faz mais sentido agora, pq aqui tudo foi mais bem pensado e organizadoInimigos e chefesA Capcom foi bem fiel ao jogo antigo em relação aos inimigos. Mudaram algumas mecânicas de boss fight, alteraram um ou dois chefes (alteração que n achei extremamente valida), adicionaram alguns modelos de inimigos e reformulam outros, adcionaram novos subchefe e manteram quase todos os antigos. Aqui só senti um pouco de criatividade para desenvolverem mais alguns subchefes, talvez um pouco menos de conservadorismo ajudasse nessa questão. Em compensação os infectados em geral estão bem mais agrecivos, bem polidos e inteligentes.Cenários e ambientaçãoMeu, aqui entregou tudo. Alguns cenários são totalmente iguais ao jogo original, outro com algumas alterações e outros totalmente novos. O que interessa neste ponto, é que foram acrencentados, elementos que nos fazem lembrar que aquilo estava no RE4 original. Dando uma sensação de nostalgia, familiarização e fluidez de game. Alguns cenários foram realmente cortados, mas ao meu ver, são partes que n acrencentam nada a trama, ou que eram cenários tediosos de se jogar. Alguns acontecimentos e cenarios são trocados durante a trama, para se encaixar melhor com os acontecimentos.A ambientação está perfeita. O jogo está sombrio em partes que devem ser sombrias, o jogos tem elementos de ação em partes que devem ter ação. Equilibraram muito bem esses dois polos de Resident, pois sempre vimos partes mais sombrias e partes com mais ação e tiroteios na franquia.Mais um ponto super positivo, não senti falta dos cenários cortados, a maneira que trabalharam, para aquilo nos passar sentimentos, foi sensacional. Além de ter novos lugares pare explorar.Personagens, dialogos, e dublagemPra começar, para mim a dublagem está muito boa. Existem muitas referências brasileiras e modernas, manteram a essência dos personagens com pequenas trocas de falas, e o jeito que os personagens se comunicam uns com os outros.Falando em comunicação de personagens, aqui vemos momentos, em que os personagens se comunicam mais uns com os outros, e interagem com o cenário, soltando algum comentário ou interagindo com o mesmo.Os personagens estão bem trabalhados, alguns mais desenvolvidos e com mais tempo de tela. E outros do mesmo jeito que sempre foi.De maneira geral, mais um ponto positivo aqui, só temos evolução e coisas que acrencentam a história do Remake.Qualidade gráfica e performnaceQue jogo lindo. a riqueza dos detalhes, modelagem, animações, luz, sombra e outros detalhes. Estão todos muito bem trabalhados, tudo nesse jogo se encaixa perfeitamente, e aqui nos gráficos, vemos uma performance muito bem trabalhada, se levamos em conta a qualidade gráfica que jogo nos entrega. O único ponto negativo que senti, foi em relação a um atraso em carregamento de texturas, mas n fois algo que atrapalhou a minha gameplay.Os requisitos do meu PC estavam entre o mínimo e o recomendado, rodei tudo no alto e não tive problemas com travamentos.Observações finaisMinha experiência jogando foi sensacional, perfeito, nostálgico e muito frenético.Eu amei o jogo em todos os aspectos, a maneira que trabalharam a evolução da história, personagens, cenários e ambientação. Deixaram o jogo perfeito e com desejo de quero mais, mesmo depois de 15h de gameplay. Minha experiência foi ótima.Vos deixo aqui minha humilde nota, 10!Obrigado a todos os envolvidos",Positive

They cut U3 (which is rumored to apperar on separate ways once the DLC launches). Cmon bruv they cut the ashley + bulldozer part. That part was awful2. There is no additional content: Wait until april 7 lol3. Bad performance and bad translations: I have a 3070 and the game runs perfect. Must say that in the rain part the performance is kinda crap. But cmon, stop trying to play this game with integrated graphics. And who tf plays dubbed games bruv??4. Youtubers got it before the release date and they were posting videos: Yes they got it before, but they were not allowed to post videos of the game til the release date. What they were able to post was their opinions and some in game footage seen before in the trailerIn conclusion, The game it's not a 5/10 game.

Изменениям подверглось все, а именно:-графика-боевка-стрельба-прокачка-персонажиПервое, что хотелось бы отметить это то что игра заставляет экономить тебя патроны. Ты думаешь чем стрелять и как стрелять. Если в оригинальной игре нож помогал экономить патроны, то тут все по другому, потому что тут нож имеет свою прочность, но это не значит, что здесь нож стал бесполезным, им можно добить противника, им можно выбраться из захвата противника, им можно парировать почти любой прием противника, но нож может сломаться и тогда вы не сможете использовать все те приемы для своей защиты. Для экономии пуль capcom добавила арбалет. В него можно зарядить обычные болты или же болты с миной. И он очень помогает в игре для экономии пуль, а если стрелять болтами с минами, то он помогает тебе и в битве с боссами.Второй плюс - это персонажи. Леона показывают, как человека, который повидал многое. (Не только в Раккун-Сити, но в игре так же рассказывается о задании Леона вместе с Краузером, где они потеряли много своих и сами чудом, как спаслись все это можно было увидеть в Resident Evil: The Darkside Chronicles) Главного героя тут сделали более серьёзнее, но бывает может разрядить обстановку шуткой. Но больше всего мне понравилась переработка Эшли. Тут она не достает тебя, как в оригинале. Здесь видно, как она старается и пытается помочь. Она не просто девушка, которую нужно спасти. Её сюжетную линию доработали в более логичную и понятную. Луис тоже доработали. Добавили ему больше экранного времени, сделали его более забавным и ответственным что ли , также они углубились в его прошлое, что и как он сделал. Было интересно за ним наблюдать. Ну Ада это Ада). Всегда загадочная, со стороны не понятно, что она от нас хочет. В конце конечно что то проясняется, но хотелось бы глянуть её путь в этой истории. Ждем ДЛС про Аду Вонг, чтобы большее понять. Краузеру тоже добавили больше экранного времени, сделали его более логичным персонажем.Третий плюс - это будут локации. Их переработали просто отлично. Все скучное или нудное что было в оригинале колоссально поменяли, тем более когда ты посещаешь последнюю местность.Игра бомба проходил на сложности ""hard"". Рекомендую!!!",Positive

How now you really need to plan out your attacks form the guns and knife . The enemy even in normal difficulty can over power you. I really enjoyed my time with the game .

I absolutely love the original and I went into this expecting a different experience cause its on the re engine now and wasn't disappointed.

251,resident-evil-4,Unoriginaluser,"Mar 30, 2023",10,"The game is pretty fun as someone who already playing since the original RE 1 BIOHAZARD I'm glad the game is out What i love is this game still retain the old plot and location but not forgetting to also new things and location and cutting some bad design. The Castle now looks more like castle with torture room and interior overhaul make thing fresh but also still retain the old school like the library and defend ashley while she activate lever switch, the puzzle already being reworked and replaced to make thing fresh, area around delago lake is can be explored freely now using boat after boss fight which is better than the original which we only using cable car. Many people saying this game too hard which is only skill issue for those people for me. The story now have many new cutscene and make the game not just some action game but have deep in lore, like now Sadler is more manacing because some cutscene have showing his mind control ability both on leon and Ashley especially ashley have sequence she try to kill leon, Salazar not just some small guy who try to be scary because he is scary in here both on design, voice and boss fight more hard because he move around not only waiting which we shot his weak spot around his body instead we need to face timing of his attack while he keep moving around so we can shot him when he open his mouth exposing his real body. Krauser have more different fight and cutscene when he died, instead of just died in explosion now he really died in leon hand and have more conversation to flash out his character and his relationship with Leon in operation Javier I play both PS5 and PC and I'm enjoying both",Positive

Para ficar perfeito só tá faltando lançarem o separate ways espero que venha logo mais porque é a única coisa que está faltando nesse remake a visão da Ada nesse jogo. Para quem está sentindo falta do inimigo u3 fique tranquilo porque ele deve aparecer na campanha da Ada, o inimigo u3 não fazia muito sentido na campanha principal, ele era um inimigo muito aleatório na campanha original e agora na campanha do remake faz muito mais sentido a linha do tempo que criada pela Capcom onde os inimigos tem um lote maior e mais detalhado e bem explicado e u3 não fazia parte disso então ele foi um excelente corte um acerto da Capcom.",Positive

264,resident-evil-4,italodpz,"Mar 29, 2023",10,"Bom, já zerei o jogo 2x então acho que já da para fazer uma análise honesta. Explorei todo o mapa, já fiz a maior parte das conquistas e da pra falar que esse jogo é uma AULA de como refazer qualquer coisa. A Capcom acertou em tudo, os gráficos estão padrão RE Engine, maravilhosos e com ambientes ricos em detalhes, você passeia pelos cenários e tem aquela sensação de déjà-vu, uma nostalgia muito boa e da para ver que tudo foi muito pensado. A história sofreu algumas modificações que ao meu ver não estraga a experiência de quem é fã do clássico, e no geral todas as mudanças feitas pela Capcom foram para melhor, tanto em questão de gameplay, história, cenários e etc.Falando da história e dos acontecimentos mais a fundo, eu gostei muito teve algumas alterações por que deram mais sentido a gameplay, a adaptação da parte da estátua gigante é foi genial, uma grande sacada pois foi um meio de trazer um elemento clássico sem ser um completo absurdo quanto era no RE4 2005. Os inimigos tem uma IA decente e te impõe dificuldade em certos momentos, e alguns inimigos são aterrorizantes como o Verdugo, Garrador e Regenerator estão mais horripilantes do que eu tinha imaginado.A dublagem é um dos pontos altos desse jogo especialmente a brasileira, está SENSACIONAL os dois atores Felipe Grinnan como Leon e a Michelle Giudice foram 2 monstros, eles deram muita alma nos diálogos e nas atuações pois você via claramente com o passar do tempo que a conexão entre o Leon e a Ashley aumentava e é muito legal ver essa entrega, pra ser sincero, eu até sentia falta da Ashley quando ela era raptada hahahaha pois é muito legal ver os dois interagindo de acordo com as situações que estão ocorrendo me parecia tudo natural.Na parte de gameplay a minha única ressalva fica na corrida do Leon, ela me parece muito rápida e meio desajeitada, o cenário é grande e claro que ele tinha que ser mais rápido pois ele recebeu treinamento militar mas se tivesse que dar nota a corrida seria um 7,5/10 talvez outras pessoas não se incomodem mas isso me chamou a atenção negativamente.Outra coisa que me incomodou é o fato de não ser possível atingir nota S+ no ranking profissional em um NewGame+, É MUITO DIFÍCIL ESSE MODO, e por mais que seja dedicado a fãs de longa data não acho que eles deveriam ter pegado tão pesado assim, mas isso é apenas um detalhe.No geral a Capcom fez um trabalho excelente esse é sem dúvidas um dos maiores jogos da história assim como foi o RE4 2005, não ser por ser um jogo excelente, mas também por ser um exemplo de como se fazer um remake. Espero que a Capcom mantenha esse padrão e definitivamente vale cada centavo, paguei R$202 na Nuuvem e não me arrependo. Apenas joguem essa obra-prima.",Positive

Геймплей лучший в серии, никогда еще так не кайфовал от оружия в резиках, а добавление головоломок и бэктрекинга еще больше разнообразило игру. На последок хотелось бы сказать, что ремейк превосходит оригинал практически во всём абсолютно.

I understand why people like it, but for me, it missed the mark. Moving forward to this remake, I believe it found a way to take fans of survival horror, and fans of RE4 and bring them together. This game, for me, is RE perfection. The game maintains its action oriented focus while allowing the true survival horror aspect to shine through just enough. I believe that the enhanced graphics and pacing really allow the game to shine and bring fans of both camps together. I cant recommend this game more highly. Dont come into this expecting an exact 1:1 recreation of the original game. Its a modern take on a classic game. I think it vastly improves it and allows it to maintain its character while improving the horror mechanics.",Positive

287,resident-evil-4,NAYKEN,"Mar 28, 2023",2,"I don't think Capcom realized how difficult a job it was undertaking before this game came out. Make the best video game ever in history again. There are so many things to say before we start examining it that I don't know where to start. In the past, when asked a question about what would have happened if Re4 had been a terrible game, everyone would have said Re5. Now the answer to this question is Re4 remake. Everything about the original game has been made terrible. Let's move on to our review. Let's start with the mechanics. I want to mention the RE Engine, although this game engine was very bad, it didn't make itself noticeable from a woody camera angle like FPS, but when the Re2 remake came out, it slowly became clear how bad this game engine was. The feel of the hit and their physics were very bulky and unresponsive, but due to the structure of Re 2 remake, the zombies already had low artificial intelligence and were not very understood in this game either. The original game was such an active game that even when the remake demo came out, I saw that the RE engine could not withstand this active gameplay and how terrible the mechanics of the game made it. Enemies often don't react when they're hit The TPS camera angle is bad, no one expected it to be as good as the original game anyway, because the original game still has the best TPS mechanics and perspective ever, and there's been no equivalent, there's just been some close ones. Unfortunately, Re4 remake has become one of the games with the worst TPS mechanics ever. As for the gameplay, there is self-defense with a knife in the game, and it definitely doesn't work properly, most of the time you get hit by the enemy, and this raises your nerve level quite a lot. I would like to mention the boss fights, but I will give them a separate place at the end of the review. Now we can move on to the department designs. There are too many sections removed from the original game and it affects the fluency of the game a lot, the village where we started the game interpreted the original game in reverse and we are going the opposite way. As for the castle section, it feels very different from the original game, most of the places have been removed, most of them have been made of terrible designs, most of them feel like a huge empty box. There is nothing to mention in the island section, most of the places have been changed, just like the castle. Unlike the original game, the episode designs do not contribute to the mechanics of the game, soulless designs. Now there is something I want to mention in the original version of Re4. Atmosphere, ambience and music these three things made the ojrnial game one of the best horror games ever in history. Re 4 remake is a disgrace in this regard, even the remake has become a complete action game. Re4 remake is the same action game as Re5. The atmosphere, ambience and music have been completely removed, you are doing nothing but shooting enemies who are flocking to you, and the terrible TPS mechanics of the game make this situation even more difficult. The terrible music has been completely removed. If you play the game in its original sounds, these soundtracks come back, but the fact that the atmosphere of the game is a disgrace negatively affects these soundtracks as well. Now we can come to the boss designs that I mentioned at the beginning of the review. All the bosses in the game repeat the same movements, whose modified designs have become incredibly easy and simple, until the fight is over. Salazar, the krauser bosses have been radically changed and have become a disgrace, I don't even want to talk about salazar in particular. Tactical analysis in bosses, you just need to rain bullets on them with your removed weapons. The bosses show their weak points themselves. As I said, the other bosses are incredibly easy to either do the same moves or jump around, especially the last boss. In addition, one of the best and most iconic bosses of the game, U-3, has been removed from the game. Along with Verdigo, I strongly condemn the makers of the two scariest and most difficult bosses in the Resident evil series. The Verdigo boss is one of the most difficult bosses in the history of the game, you feel almost soulslike desperation, and now that this difficulty has been completely eliminated, you can rain all your bullets on Verdigo. There are a few things I would like to mention one last time. I want to talk about the character modeling of the game. In this game, the photorealistic character graphics continue, and all the characters look so terrible. Separate ways, Assignment Ada and mercenaries are not in the game. We came to the end of our review, the original game was the best game ever in history, Capcom couldn't handle it. If they had pushed a little harder, it would have been a game as outrageous as Re Village and Operation Raccoon City Re 4 remake. As for the rating of the game, 20/100",Negative
288,resident-evil-4,Verdola,"Mar 28, 2023",9,"Finalizei Re4 Remake, sem duvidas um dos melhores, se não o melhor, remake q já teve, além da varias melhorias gráficas e de gameplay, tbm teve as da historia, q deixou ela com um tom bem mais serio(seinen, para os mais íntimos) e assustador, mas mantendo a essência do original e até aprimorando ela, todos os personagens foram expandidos e ficaram bem melhores desenvolvidos, principalmente o Luís Serra, o kra no original só morria e fds, já aqui n, ele participa bem mais e ajuda muito mais o Leon, além de ter o background expandido. E sem sombras de duvidas uma das melhores mudanças, foi a Ashley, n falando só da aparência(está ∞ vezes mais bonita e fofa), mesmo a personalidade e ações dela no jogo estão bem melhores, ela n tá tão mais chata, tem muito mais linhas de dialogo no jogo e muito mais personalidade, além de q ela age muito mais por conta própria, ate mesmo ajudando e salvando o Leon algumas vezes, mas embora essa parte dela agir por conta própria, tenha se dado de maneira muito natural, teve alguns momentos q a Capcom forçou a barra pra meter isso, como no final, em q a Ashley da em cima do Leon e pede pra ele ser o guarda-costas dela e ele diz q ela n precisa pois já demonstrou conseguir agir por conta própria, o jeito q ele falou ficou muito estranho. As adições do remake ficaram simplesmente espetaculares, como as quests do mercador, novas áreas, e etc. tudo só serviu pra elevar ainda mais oq a obra original tinha a oferecer, como um verdadeiro remake deve ser. Tendo dito isso, minha nota final é 9,5/10 o jogo é realmente espetacular e faz jus ao original, a nota dele só n foi dez por causa da forçação com a Ashley e por causa de alguns cortes de conteúdo original, q por mais q n sejam tão relevantes, ainda são cortes.",Positive

310,resident-evil-4,kingofkoopas,"Mar 27, 2023",7,"Just finished it and I really like it, but it has disappointed me. There are a few things that kept this remake from swimming in the same territory of greatness as the original. The game needs iframes badly. The enemies and bosses can hit you over and over before you can properly recover. This gets extremely frustrating. In the original, Leon moves stiffly but is swift once you start running. In the remake Leon is really clunky(not the same as stiff) and it makes running feel really off, and in fights it can be infuriating. Its significantly worse than the running in ""The Witcher 3"". I don't care if it makes his movement more real, its not immersive because it makes movement really frustrating. In the last fight, right before you fire the red rocket at Saddler, I got stunned locked by the tentacle and almost died. I couldn't do anything but watch Leon take 4 hits from the tentacles. That is just one example of nearly a hundred in one playthrough. How many of you have called bullcrap on dynamite sticks being thrown at you? The game has a difficulty problem as well, it throws wild curve balls at you from time to time. I started on hardcore and the opening was getting to me. Until I realized that the time you have to survive is shorter than the original, but it was well done. The fight with Mendez was a joke, the second part of it was just scripted/movie garbage, not real gameplay. The fight with Lago was really easy this time, you don't fall off the boat if you hit the trees in the water....Then there are parts that are very very difficult such as the Regeneratos and Iron Maidens. They are much too fast for how clunky Leon is. They were difficult in the original, but here they are nightmarish. The Novistadors have been reduced to absolute cannon fodder, why are they even in the game? Last and probably least are the design choices, some of this might be nitpicking on my part but I will list some anyway. Ada's voice in English is horrendously bad, its jarring, it takes me out of the experience of the game. Its like something out of a Neil Breen movie. Krauser's is quite bad too, horrible voice, but unlike Ada's, at least the voice actor is trying to act and not read lines like he's dying from a serious case of boredom. The game is going for a darker, more horror look over the original and in most areas I think it succeeds, but when it doesn't it fails miserably. Take the wolf enemies for example, they look too chubby and almost cute. In the original they looked like real animals and thus a bit scary to fight. Chief Mendez too, he just looks like a big chunky dude, not sinister like in the original. The first Garrador was not only too easy, but they also removed his torturous and unnerving scream. The Chainsaw maniac's eyes are too bright and cutesy...Ugh why? Then they removed the one fight in the original that can be scary or at least creepy, the fight with ""It"". I was also hoping they wouldn't load the game with needless cursing, but its 2023 and it was naïve to hope for that. The game doesn't have mercenaries either which I find very disappointing. The game is totally worth it and if they were to patch some of the things I mentioned, then the remake could stand next to the original easily. I am starting to convince myself that some people were right about the RE Engine, its not very good, at least not for RE4's much faster gameplay.",Average
311,resident-evil-4,RE4RGOTY,"Mar 27, 2023",10,"This is most obvious GOTY of all time! As a Remake, it's amazing. As a standalone modern video game, it's amazing. It's fun, it's scary, it has action, it has horror. It's not just copy+paste ""new graphics on old game"", nope. This is, in many ways, expanded and updated version of RE4. I would say, 99% of the new addions and changes are absolutely welcomed and well done. Graphically it literally looks like ""next-gen"". Rain/storm looks great and makes it obvious that pre-release footage was just some ""beta"" stages. Obviously no game is perfect, i could always complain about something, anything (that goes for any game btw). But i almost don't want to, it's just as close to perfection as modern remake could be. Dead Space Remake was solid, very good. But this one is next level compared to that one. To bring out some negatives, as a die hard RE4 fan, i was obviously disappointed that U-3 was cut. U-3 had very interesting design and fight was fun and scary and would have worked perfectly in this new remake. I'm not really sure why the cut it, but i'm hopeful that maybe they are holding it for dlc. BUT that didn't break the game for me at all, everything else was great, most boss fights were amazing and expanded content helped as well. Atmosphere was absolutely flawless on all three locations (village,castle,island). Voice acting (for the most part) was great. My biggest surprise was Ashley, she was perfect! I was never huge Ashley fan, in the original she was extremely annoying, but in the remake she almost felt like new character (in a good way). Leon's voice acting was solid, as expected. Overall script/dialogue was also nice, i especially liked moments between Leon and Ashley. At the end of the day, i don't even care if it wins any awards, all i can say is, that it's very good game and that's the most important thing. But when development team puts so much passion into a project like this, i think it should be rewarded.",Positive

319,resident-evil-4,CorruptShaolin,"Mar 26, 2023",10,"This game is peak Resident Evil, it hits all marks in every category. The action based survival horror genre was made because of the OG RE4 and it makes sense that this game would come back 20 times stronger. The action was just absolutely great. Non stop entertainment. Fighting a bunch of different enemies who have different ways of attacking you and bosses that were just fun as hell to fight against. The visuals and graphics are probably one of the best in the world right now, up there with Demon Souls and Red Dead 2, probably even better. My favorite part of the entire game was the sound design. Sound design in video games are so crucial and undervalued these days, it's great to see them accomplish what they did in this game. The sound of the footsteps walking in different terrains, the sounds of the guns shooting or reloading, the sound of the menu and navigating the UI, just an absolute ASMR fest with the sound. The same directors who directed RE2 remake also were the directors in this remake and it makes complete sense. The game gives you the ability to explore and figure things out at your own pace and gives you the ability to make your playthrough unique just like RE2 remake did. I loved every second of this game and after finishing it immediately jumped back in to a second playthrough for some more and it still feels fresh. Any game that can make me go back in and play a second time not too long after completion is a rare W. I see a ridiculous amount of 0s in ratings on this game from user reviews and it's actually embarrassing the amount of people who simply hate review just to be nuisance. Anyone giving this game a 0 is a joke. It's a survival horror - action game, anyone who complains about resource management in a video game shouldn't be playing RE games. Just saying. It runs incredibly well on PC and gives you a lot of options to tweak the graphics to your liking. Capcom delivers once again! The greatest video game dev in the business who actually give fans what they want and don't make you wait too long for it. They've been putting out new games that fans have been asking for every single year and they continue to outdo themselves. Thank you Capcom for yet another absolute masterpiece!",Positive

RE4R is a great game however my main frustrating and annoying things this remake does. Enemies are like bullet sponges how many bullets does it take to down an enemy? The dogs..I hate these things they know actually where you aim and they zig zag and leap and attack you. The areas are so snug around you and you have like an ambush of Enemies blocking a single path waiting for you and yes they block doors with more swarms of enemies yelling at you ""Get him, don't let him escape"" in Spanish. Best way is to throw a grenade and if you don't have on have mercy on you and good luck. Aiming swaying is another frustrating situation that you aim the camera will move like you're on a boat. Upgrades sometimes feel unnoticeable early on in the game. The game does offer new ways to upgrade the case with Keychains to which they do have great benefits. The mini game is fun and much rewarding i spend like 4 hours in the first shooting range. RE4R is great but not great than the og RE4 and RE2R is a much better remake in terms of remakes go from the franchise. My score is an 8..technical issues haven't come across yet so far smooth but i find some areas blurry, no crashes.

It's just an imposter wearing the skin of a better game.  Let's break down a few things: Tone:The tone of RE4 was one that perfectly balanced action and b-movie horror camp.  Leon was a seasoned special ops veteran years after the events of RE2.  He was smart, sassy, a bit of a flirt, but still took his job seriously.  Several of his iconic lines from the original are here in this game...but their delivery falls completely flat because they are being delivered by RE2-Remake Leon, not RE4 Leon.  And that shift in character and tone /fundamentally/ changes everything about this game.  RE2-Remake Leon is a boring misery guts, and that tone carries over here, ruining the vibe that defined RE4. Dialogue:Many of the famous Leon sassy lines from RE4 are here, but again they don't fit with this version of Leon.  It feels forced, and I hate that feeling.  Additionally Luis' slightly flirtatious, lecherous character has been completely sanded off.  In RE4 he makes a passing remark about Ashley's chest...which she rightfully calls him out for and chews him out.  Removing Ashley's agency and removing this dialogue from the game removes these fun character moments.  There's also dialogue removed where Ashley offers herself to Leon after everything they've been through, giving a lead female character a nice bit of sexual agency that the remake takes away.  Leon turns her down of course, he's a professional and not a perv, and it was nice to see that interaction play out realistically and maturely.  There's just so much character and sass from the original game that seems to have been sanded off somewhere along the way. Color:This may be a petty complaint, but...all the RE engine games are really dark and look washed out in their environment design.  The original, while mostly awash with browns and greens, was still brightly lit and looked dynamic due to great art direction.  The RE4-Remake environments certainly look more detailed, but everything just looks too cluttered and dark.  There's something about the design for many of the REmakes in the RE Engine that just does not work for me.  It lacks...vibrancy and sense of artistic variation.  This leaves environments just feeling monotonous somehow. Gameplay:I don't understand the decision to add meaningless busywork to RE4-Remake.  The original had lots of optional short bonus objectives for money, but those were quick and usually just for extra collectibles (completely optional).  In the RE4-Remake, there are way too many ""go here kill 3 rats"" / ""backtrack into another area and break something"" side missions.  They feel like open world busywork, and it feels like you /have/ to do them because the loot system in the remake is so much stingier with quality drops. Character Models:Like...there are a few characters I think that are actually as good as RE4 or better in the remake (Hunnigan and Mendez look terrific), but Ashley looks like Leon with a longer, stupider haircut.  Salazar looks /atrocious/.  Saddler looks...okay albeit bland.  Again, RE4 even with its limited graphics gave these characters such life and personality with good art direction, but the stiff, awkwardness of the RE Engine models just look...like **** It's a fine way to play RE4 if that's all you want...but it's not as good as the original.  Not even remotely close.",Negative

351,resident-evil-4,oDescomplicador,"Mar 25, 2023",10,"RE4 Remake é primoroso, abaixo minha análise vou tentar evitar spoilers! 9.8/10 O jogo apresenta uma excelente atualização do Resident Evil 4 Clássico, os inimigos tem um excelente design, a forma e o fluxo como o jogo funciona é simplesmente maravilhoso, desde o combate mais simples à base do parry e tiro nos olhos ao combate mais avançado incluindo organizar a maleta com poucos recursos em grandes batalhas, a exploração nos cenários e a disponibilidade de tesouros pra encontrar também é massiva, a gameplay tá simplesmente perfeita, a gente começa e quando vai chegando perto do fim vai batendo aquela tristeza por que a gente sabe que tá perto do fim, o castelo, a vila, a ilha tudo está incrível, claro que eu não podia deixar de falar da dublagem que de começo eu estranhei mas agora já acostumei e não tem nada mais gostoso que ouvir ""Você tem um fraco por um tesourinho né não?"" A palavra que eu tenho pra descrever esse jogo é apenas PRIMOROSO, o empenho em melhorar o que já era bom é incrível, apesar dos pesares pra mim faltou muito pouco pra ser perfeito, porém tive alguns pequenos encomodos que dentre eles foram algumas animações de morte que eu tive a sensação que não foram finalizadas, e a expressão facial dos personagens fora das cutscenes fica um pouco estranha, outro ponto é que até o momento joguei em duas dificuldades (Intenso e padrão) no intenso os inimigos tem o nível de saúde ideal, da trábalho de matar mas não é chato pelo contrário é recompensador, porém é MUITO escasso de munição, chega num ponto que somos obrigado a usar a Balestra contra o Bruto que nem toma dano praticamente, acaba sendo chato, já no padrão não falta munição na maior parte do tempo mas tive a sensação que os inimigos morrem cedo demais, em particular o garrador que de primeira fui sem danos com umas 4 balas de rifle na plaga e algumas de pistola, esses por menores não impedem desse ser um dos, se não o melhor Resident Evil de todos os tempos, vale muito a compra, se tiver condição, apoie a indústria, enquanto tem empresa saindo do Brasil e jogo saindo em 2023 até sem legenda cof cof p.t, a Capcom investiu uma nota pra trazer até dublagem, valorizando nossa cultura, a gente se vê, obrigado por ficar comigo até aqui!",Positive

354,resident-evil-4,IfOnly,"Mar 25, 2023",10,"It's almost sad that i have to say this, but Capcom is one of those very last game developers who actually cares about delivering amazing game, that fans have been waiting for.

355,resident-evil-4,SrSecundo,"Mar 25, 2023",10,"Como um fã desde de criança desse magnífico título, posso dizer com todas as minhas forças, esse jogo está tão bom quanto o original, e até melhor em diversos aspectos. Entretanto, vou colocar minha análise dividida em tópicos porque quero fazer algo mais trabalhado para essa lenda (mesmo que colocar aqui apenas ""THE GOTY"" já seria o suficiente). História:Deixaram fiel à original, e até mesmo acrescentaram coisas que fazem tudo ser ainda mais imersivo. Tudo que vi só melhorou, nada a reclamar nesse aspecto, até mesmo os colecionáveis tem cada um sua própria explicação e fidelidade aos seus antecessores. Gameplay:Ficou magnífica, o Leon se movimenta muito bem, a Ashley se tornou muito mais útil para todo o contexto que o jogo quer e consegue passar. O stealth que era difícil de se imaginar que pudesse se conectar ao jogo, agora faz parte de sua essência, todas as mecânicas de armas, exclusivos, faca e colete se tornaram melhores e mais realistas. Gráficos:Entendo que muitos dos jogadores possam estar enfrentando problemas de carregamento de texturas e tudo mais, porém a minha experiência induvial foi muito boa, praticamente qualquer parte do jogo tem um potencial gigante para se tornar uma print para a galeria, principalmente por esse recurso de desaparecer as barras de vida e arma (modo foto também é uma grande ajuda para quem quer elevar essa experiência). Voltando para o assunto da textura e lags, o jogo se tornou bem mais otimizado que a demo e com os possíveis próximos patchs, tudo pode ser resolvido. Mini-games e missões secundárias:Algo que fazia parte do que é RE4, o estande de tiro foi reaproveitado e melhorado a um ponto em que sempre que aparecia eu queria ficar lá por horas até conseguir completar 100% em tudo, porém vale acrescentar a questão das missões secundárias que conseguiram se adaptar ao jogo e tornaram-o ainda mais imersivo (coisa que também era de difícil adaptação). Mercador:Sim, eu criei um tópico só para o mercador, MANO OQUE É ISSO, como fizeram o mercador ser mais e mais legal do que já era??? As opções de troca, compra e up das armas se tornaram bem mais legais, com a narração para cada tipo de seleção, é muito bom ouvir ele falando sempre que vou olhar o menu das coisas, simplesmente magnífico! Dublagem:Vou avaliar apenas a PT-BR. Entendo que muitos possam ter entrado em um conflito com a voz não familiar do mercador, mais fina, porém temos que admitir, ficou extremamente boa também, todas as dublagens desse jogo foram feitas com extremo carinho para todos os fãs que esperavam jogos dublados dessa saga já fazia muito tempo (RE8 nos trouxe pela primeira vez e graças a um bom Deus, a Capcom também aderiu para 4 RE). Parabéns aos editores, dubladores e também à própria Capcom pelo incentivo. Tesouros e mapa:Gostei da mecânica que o mapa trouxe, herdada do título original, não precisamos ficar adivinhando onde as coisas estão, mas sim enfrentar desafios para que possamos as conquistar. Isso me faz me sentir bem mais na obrigação de ir atrás das coisas e por fim ficar jogando e aproveitando esse grande jogo por mais tempo, oque também ajuda na imersão do jogo. Fidelidade:Enfim, esse é o último tópico, devo dizer que 90% das coisas foram fieis e extremamente bem adaptadas para esse novo jogo, e que a Capcom quando quer, consegue ensinar qualquer concorrência oque é um REMAKE que dá gosto de comparar com o original, parabéns a todos que trabalharam no remake de uma lenda que também se tornou outra lenda. Não esperem menos que um GOTY, vocês merecem! Agora tenho que ir, mas saio totalmente satisfeito de ter confiado na pré-venda dessa beleza =) Nota: 1000000000000000000000000000000000/10 Condor Um desligando.",Positive

It's just so well done. It's basically same logic that goes for quality games like Red Dead Redemption, that even people who usually don't play open-world, would still try it. World design was perfection, music/atmosphere/rain were all great, most new boss designs were phenomenal and voice acting for both Leon and Ashley was solid.

363,resident-evil-2,Young_Fawn,"Jun 21, 2023",9,"All Remakes Should Be Of This Quality Resident Evil 2 Remake is a phenomenal game which offers a large amount of content for the price that you pay for it. It is one of those games where you will truly get your money's worth, especially when it goes on sale. First of all there are two campaigns, Claire and Leon. They are similar but different in a multitude of ways, different endings, different parts of the Police Station you can access, different weapons, but once you play your second playthrough as the opposite character from your starting one, you'll notice that some parts of the game are more or less the same. The game looks amazing, the amount of detail the graphic designers put into the police station and other set pieces to make the game look realistic is outstanding, there are so many small and fine details that are easy to miss but if you just take a moment to appreciate it, you'll notice the real love that went into this game. Combat is pretty decent, but if you go around trying to permanently put down every zombie you see, you'll run out of ammo fast. There is only a set limit of how much ammo you can obtain each playthrough, enemies do not drop extra ammo upon killing them, which players might be used to if they've come from playing the 4-6 games. The part that makes the game proper survival horror, is knowing when to fight and when to run, consider saving your ammo for when you truly need it. The puzzles are great and I personally don't think the backtracking in this game feels as tedious as it does in most games, mainly due to the fact that you might think you've cleared an area but something has changed whilst you've been away or some random zombie has decided to go for a wander and now he's there to contend with. The puzzles themselves aren't necessarily difficult but as long as you keep ample inventory space, you'll be fine. The story is pretty decent, it's really just about surviving and trying to get out of the City and more revelations reveal themselves about the origin of the breakout and what not as you progress; as well as different files dotted around the map to give you some context and some world building, but in terms of storytelling it's definitely not on the same level as something like Death Stranding or Detroit Become Human. I only had one gripe with the game and it wasn't consistent all the way through, sometimes you do just get slapped with special infected or a copious unmanageable mount of Zombies at one time, and you can easily be stun locked if you're not careful. It's also worth noting that after completing the game you unlocked ""2nd Run"" mode, which basically is the same game but the items are in different places and certain things play out differently, it gives the game excellent replayability as you won't know the locations of all the items you got in your first playthrough. More games should learn from this. Another fantastic feature is the ""Records"" bonus content, where you get three short scenarios about three different characters from the game that aren't really expanded upon. Most developers/publishers would have released this as a paid DLC, but it's completely FREE and in the game, giving you some new characters to play with a new scenario to play out. So there's some extra content after you finish the main campaigns, once or twice. Overall, Resident Evil 2 is a testament to how games that were limited by their technology at the time can be remade into near perfection. This is how the game was meant to be played and any developer, in my opinion, that remakes a game that does not fit this standard of remake that Resident Evil 2 offers, shouldn't bother making it. 9/10, you will absolutely not regret this purchase.",Positive

Also there are some new elements: gun powder, wood planks for the windows, and so on. The one thing that I didnt like was Mr. Tyrant and his hunt for the player, especially in the 2nd campaign.The story has also some improvements and is more complex. I just didnt like some scenes, because they were a bit childish and not realistic. Also the 2nd campaign is not realistic, because it didnt fit in the the first campaign.

I consolidated some thoughts I had about it previously and introduced her to the game. There are so many things to talk about... First of all, the gameplay. The level design here is impeccable in a way that, when you start the game, you don't realize that you will be familiarized so much with it. That's what happened with my gf. She complained about the size of it, saying that was too much to learn. Eventually, she was running around figuring out things by herself and enjoying it. besides, when the game requires exploration in order to progress and outplay the enemies, it becomes natural. And there's Mr. X also... man, she was terrified. Even I, whose already beaten the game, was anxious about his steps. The plot involves you fast. The premise itself is crazy. You wanna know what is happening impersonally when you arrive at the police station, but how much more you are deep into that **** the more you wanna know since a lot of things are at stake. Also, the graphics are so good here. The characters aren't unidimensional, and the facial expressions help them so much to transmit it. Talking about that subject, we can not forget about the gore. Jess, it's crazy good and satisfying. At least, but not less important, the audio design. For some reason, I decided to put my soundbar on my desktop. I put the bar below the monitor and the subwoofer below the desk and man... We could feel the pressure of the flame thrower, every shot with the sub and the steps of Mr. X were even more terrifying.

390,resident-evil-2,BulgarianCritic,"Apr  8, 2023",8,This is by far one of the best remakes of a pretty old game (which I wouldn't have bothered even playing if it wasn't for this). There are very minor technical issues and the PC Port is top notch. The changes that they have done give the game a more modern feel but it still plays a bit like an old school game (inventory management and all that jazz). Story is pretty mid and it partially becomes boring by the end( the romance part also made zero sense). Enemy variety is decent but the maps are what makes this pretty great (good variety with unique locations). I can't remember anything from the soundtrack so I can't comment if it was good or bad. Definitely worth the price for this classy remake.,Positive

Well RE:2 has too much darkness and it is great in some parts but using too much this makes you adapt and don't feel the fear as in RE 8. However it improved the 7 because it's not always running away from the enemies as in RE 7. Very very good game, but not perfect. Solo he jugado a RE 7,8 y 2. Aún así lo he notado como uno de los mejores survival horrors que he jugado. El 10 se lo queda RE 8 que mide los tiempos y las situaciones con exactitud.

400,resident-evil-2,metju,"Feb  9, 2023",9,"Resident Evil 2 Remake is a masterful retelling of one of the most iconic survival horror games of all time. The game's graphics have been completely overhauled, giving the world and its inhabitants a new level of detail and immersion. The gameplay mechanics have also been updated, making the experience feel fresh while still staying true to the original's roots. The story remains unchanged, following Leon S. Kennedy and Claire Redfield as they navigate the zombie-infested Raccoon City. The tension and suspense have been ramped up to new levels, making each encounter with the undead a heart-pounding experience. The puzzles are just as challenging as they were in the original, but with the added bonus of beautiful, high-resolution visuals. The sound design is top-notch, with every shot, groan, and scream adding to the atmosphere. The voice acting is also noteworthy, with excellent performances from the cast bringing the characters to life. In conclusion, if you're a fan of the original Resident Evil 2 or are just looking for a terrifying and well-made survival horror game, this Remake is a must-play. It's a testament to the timeless appeal of the original and a showcase of what can be achieved with modern technology. Highly recommended!",Positive

Played on consoles back in 2019 and now that I upgraded my rig with a 3080ti I was ready to replay re2 at native 4k with ray tracing all ULTRA at 60FPS, what a blast. The graphics and the creative design are the main features here. Inventory management is a mini-game inside the game that kept me compulsively optimizing the space and making decisions about which ITEMS to keep or store. There is a ton of incentives to keep playing the game. After completing the 1st and 2nd run with both characters, I got a cheap DLC to activate all unlocks. I was done with the game by that time, but I kept coming back. Playing as Claire with the military custom, made the whole experience more real for me, as a Female Civilian blasting her way when on places where many trained security forces died was a hard sell for starters. But that military custom with the STARS patch on it made sense for me, and the infinite ammo MP5 and Handgun helped me to replay the game several times without grinding for bullets and ITEMS. I have like 120+ playtime hours on STEAM on this game, given it's a linear single-player story, that is a LOT!

Just like almost any Resident Evil game, it suffers from an amazing first half and a so-so second half. The Police Station and Mr. X are the golden highlights of the game and are filled with tension because of how underequipped you are and how Mr. X actually looks for you instead of just spawning near your location, to the point where you can run off to the other part of the police station and not see him for 10 minutes. Unfortunately, the other half pales in comparison. The boss fights range from mediocre to bad, like that crane one. Two playthroughs are a must because Leon and Claire's paths are indeed different enough to warrant replayability.",Positive

424,resident-evil-2,wokenoodle,"Aug 30, 2022",9,"Having played the original, I can only judge the game on its own merits - and they are plentiful. Both visuals and sounds are doing a fantastic job immersing you in a dreadful situation your characters have found themselves in, but the level, enemy, and encounter designs are what truly keep you on your toes the whole time. The puzzles are intuitive yet sometimes pretty clever, and, together with resource management and routing, they form a solid, thoughtful gameplay loop punctuated by seamless transitions between levels and locations. These environments are emaculately well done, too, although hardly original by todays standards. The Orphanage, though, will definetly stay in my mind for some time. The later levels dragged just a bit in my experience and culminated in bossfights I would consider tedious, but that didn't hinder my enjoiment much. The plot is challenging for me to say anything about, as the Resident Evil mythos is very mature and influential, so nowadays the story may feel a tad naive, but it surely is competent, and the characters, although shallow, are appealing. Resident Evil 2: Remake was a fantastic way for me to experience a classic and is a great game overall.",Positive

The gameplay itself is fun as always, going through puzzles, searching all over the place for hints and clues, scavaging the whole area etc. Classic for RE game. Must admit, how well this game handles difficulty, no matter what did you choose, the game always presents you with the need of managing every last bit of your resource, thinking about shooting that one enemy or running off, healing up now or leaving it for a grimmer situation and more stuff like that.

Capcom could add more variety in different paths. - The second run is almost the same as the first one with both characters. The sequence of events is a little different but the game is the same. You play again for a new boss fight and a 3 minutes animation at the end. - Lore problems. The antagonist should have died from the bullets he got when he was human (should rewrite that scene).

452,resident-evil-2,MGamer490,"Dec  6, 2021",9,"Was always intending on playing this game after my time with Resident Evil 1 HD, with my plan to complete all the main line RE games within the next year or two. I was highly anticipating this game in the series based on the incredible reception it received in 2019 when it released. I should mention also that I never played the original game, so I don't have a comparison for you here. Visuals - This game is absolutely gorgeous, the character models look great whether it be your human characters such as Leon, Claire, Sherry or Ada, or the zombies which I spent some time looking at their character models in the menu, there is a lot of detail put into the visuals and you will notice this almost immediately, the atmosphere of each section in the game is great, from the police station, to the sewer, the lab etc. Combat - I played on standard difficulty, there are options to play Hardcore but you will be limited in saves which I wasn't a fan of from the first RE game so opted out for this one. It is a survival horror so avoiding combat is helpful to you when you can, but when it is needed, I felt very much in control of what I was doing. The shooting mechanics work great, you cannot just spam your shooting otherwise your accuracy will suffer and headshots are very important, shooting zombies is a treat as you can see sections of their body tear off as you take your shots and it is visually very pleasing. Other sections of combat would be your boss battles and felt they were all fun, following a similar format to zombies, shoot and run, the only thing I would have wished for was a dodge button of some sort, as sometimes it was difficult to avoid getting attacked, this was introduced in later RE games, but yeah would've been nice to have it here, not necessary though. Combat is a big plus for me and a big step up from the RE1 remake where I mostly felt I had very little control of what I was doing in combat. Story - You have a choice between playing as Leon or Claire, after a google search, it seemed most people were recommending to play as Claire first and then do Leon in the 2nd Run section as that concludes the story completely. I have played as Claire in full, but Leon I am currently in the middle of my 2nd Run with him. I cannot give a full view of the story, but just from Claire's story, I was very much satisfied, sibling of Chris Redfield, who I know very well, I am not as familiar with Claire so this was a real treat for me. Both characters head into Racoon City together to find it overrun with zombies and the plan is rather simple, seek help, but when that fails, get out, though both find alternate goals along their tale. Overall, happy with the story, nothing too complex, just what I wanted. Performance - Rather quick thing to go over but played on my relatively decent gaming PC at max settings for most things (or close to max settings), You get a lot of options in selecting how you want the game to look and perform which is really nice as you can limit certain things you don't care for to improve performance and the ensure your PC can handle it. During my gameplay, I didn't encounter a single issue, no crashes, no major framerate issues, no glitches, was a 10/10 performance experience. Scary - For me personally, not really, but I am a fan of horror and can handle it quite well, the atmosphere of the game is fantastic, it does create the vibe of being cautious of what is around certain corners, what is really dead, and it does contain some jump scares but nothing too major. I definitely felt creeped out during parts but I was mostly impressed with just how well designed it is, the police station feels relatively simple and you may encounter a zombie falling from a higher floor which may startle you, but when you move to locations like the sewers or the lab, you will find different enemies that may get a reaction out of you. Expoloration and Item Management - Not much to say here, but it was difficult to do this in the first RE as the game is not designed with modern gameplay styles and it was kind've a slog to get through, but for RE2, you will be balancing out weapons for combat, to keep you alive and to solve puzzles. Expect to explore around each location and grab whatever you can to help you, if you like to look in every nook and cranny, this will be your cup of tea, I loved it in this game, was great to find different items and never once got stuck where I needed a walkthrough. You will be going back to save rooms to swap out items often, but you do come across pouches that increase your carry capacity which is so welcomed from me. Final Rating - I only have minor issues in relation to the game, I never felt that I was having a bad time, it was a complete reverse with how I felt about RE1, this game took everything I loved from RE1 and perfected it into a modern game for the 2nd in the series.",Positive

460,resident-evil-2,SgAkErRu,"Sep 15, 2021",9,"Лучшая часть во франшизе RE (разумеется по моему мнению и на данный момент). Короче, игра шикарная: бэктрекинг, головоломки, ленты для сохранений, более менее некринжовый научно-фантастический сюжет, в общем все как у оригинала и у 1-й части. А так же из нового: крутой графон, хорошее звуковое сопровождение, отличный редизайн персонажей (я просто посмотрел, как выглядели Клэр и Леон во всяких 6-ых и Revelations 2...), Мистер X, манящая атмосфера, немного переработанный в лучшую сторону сюжет. Короче, чем игра хороша, уже рассказали по 500 раз. Про плохую сторону медали люди говорили реже. Но у игры есть несколько недостатков, которые меня просто вымораживают и не дают поставить почти заслуженную 10/10. В общем, эти минусы кроются в сюжете и лоре. В оригинальной RE2 было что-то похожее на пересечение сценариев, когда действие, совершенное игроком в сценарии А, влияло на происходящее в сценарии Б. Хотя и в оригинале полно такого, что вам приходится в разных сценариях за разных персонажей крутить один и тот же вентиль, и т. д. Так вот, в ремейке вообще нет никакой взаимосвязи между сценариями, кроме нескольких кат-сцен. Причем все попытки выстроить эту взаимосвязь в голове ни к чему не приводят, ведь здесь не то, что таймлайны не совпадают, это вообще будто параллельные вселенные. Ибо, мы валим одних и тех же боссов, разгадываем одни и те же загадки, ходим по тем же самым локациям (за исключением пару мест, где разрабы сделали уникальные мини-локи для каждого персонажа). А ведь можно было выстроить крутые пересечения, которые бы и дополняли историю, и показывали сценарное мастерство разработчиков, и предоставляли игрокам новый контент. Для этого, как минимум, надо было бы сделать альтернативные пути для каждого из сценариев, т.е сделать уникальные головоломки, уникальные локации для каждого из них, чтобы было понятно, что Леон делал в это время одно, а Клэр - другое, и время от времени показывать как наши действия влияют на другого персонажа. Особенно ТУПО, что разрабы так сделали когда-то в DLC Separate Ways для RE4, где в целом было реализовано то, о чем я говорю (с косячками, но было). Тут же, вообще ничего нет. В общем, это халтура. Увы, пересечений сюжетов нет, и это очень расстраивает. Очень. Согласитесь, если сценарии были бы по-настоящему другими и проработанными, было бы еще круче, а у игры и так вроде неплохой рейтинг, даже с учетом этой вот фигни. На самом деле серьезный недостаток, но в остальном игра очень крутая. В общем как-то так. Спасибо, что прочитали, если прочитали.",Positive
461,resident-evil-2,PrincessRose,"Jul 26, 2021",7,"I played the original 1998 RE2 and I absolutely loved the game then and this is  a really well done remake of a epic game. Can't remember the original very well as I played that over 20 years ago. RE2 has always been a scary, thrilling game that still freaks me out at times and is about trying to survive to get out more so than killing zombies as I try to avoid them with a bullet to the knee if I can't run past them easily so I don't waste ammo. The puzzles are good, challenging enough without being overly difficult to figure out. It also has great characters and story. The only thing I don't like is that the story is a bit disjointed and doesn't flow in the 2nd run of whoever you didn't play the first time. But I wont give details as don't want to spoil it for those who have never played.And extra modes aren't my thing. I am not interested in speed runs as that's all the extra modes are for trying to test your skills in trying to complete it as fast as possible. This is a must play game even if you didn't play the original.",Average

463,resident-evil-2,Sergei62,"Jun 27, 2021",8,"Если ремейки как правило, что фильмов что игр, летят в топку, то capcom данный продукт сделал просто шедеврально. Сохранена атмосфера игры и даже наверное, я бы сказал она стала более зловещей, гнетущей и пугающей. Игра постоянно держит игрока в напряге, не давая расслабится ни на секунду и это тоже огромный плюс. Плюс некоторые не большие но приятные нововведения, не разрушающие общую атмосферу игры.Из минусов я бы отметил, прохождение игры второй раз, хоть пути у Леона и Клэр немного разные что поддерживает интерес к игре. Ну сделать одних и тех же боссов в одних и тех же местах, после того как ты уже убил их, на этом месте в предыдущее прохождение, это как мне кажется зашквар.",Positive
464,resident-evil-2,Umbrella-17,"Jun 18, 2021",8,"This game is weird. For many reasons its great. Visually its amazing and respect the original arts style mostly. But also, it doesn't respect the original at all when it comes to locations. And contents its kind of sad. Many bosses have been either completely changed mostly for the worst. Many iconic areas have been cut or changed too much to be identifiable. The soundtrack is almost inexistent something to me that is part of RE2 classic charm sure you could buy the Classic soundtrack pack but I was wishing for orchestral version of many of the track. Also, I must say I am unsure about the characters I sometime feel like Leon is too dumb and naïve the original was better balanced on this level. Claire is really good on the other hand. Now on the touchy subject what about the Zombie who sponge bullets like crazy. I think its a little too much. The fact that they take a lot of bullets maybe 6 to 10 is one thing but when it takes 15 to 20 bullets its kind of stupid also the shotgun is bad someone missed the class when it was mean to dispatch large number of zombies. For the story its mostly intact but some characters where clearly more interesting in the original well some are the exact opposite.  In the end is Resident evil 2 remake better than Resident evil 2 my 29 years old brain says no. But for someone who didn’t played the original it’s a great game I feel like I would have like it better with no expectation at all. I kind of wish they would have gone the RE1 remake way and remake RE 2 entirely with every beats. I am okay with changing Leon a little bit and Claire also some characters even fix some retcon Leon saying a one liner from RE4 was a great idea. But I still think they should have kept the world mostly the same. I felt like the Lab was too small and sewer too long. Also, a last point Mr-X I hate him. In itself is new look is great and how he search you is great. But in the original he would just appear during B Scenario. Letting you enjoy your first playthrough slowly explore the world and learn everything. In the remake he will hunt you most of the game kind of like Nemesis. Which was a dumb move because they lost the surprise of Nemesis for the sequel.",Positive

Which is nice, don't get me wrong, I love a good puzzle, but an hour to figure it out takes me out of the game.

474,resident-evil-2,MrPajamas,"Apr 28, 2021",9,"I never played the original Resident Evil 2, so when I found out about the remake, it didn't take long and I had the honor to try this game. I was quite interested in it, because I never played two and I was simply uninitiated about RE2, but the remake fixed it all. So I'm going to talk about the remake. Unfortunately, I can't compare much, because I didn't play the original game, as I mentioned. What immediately took my breath away was the graphics. No, I don't think anyone would be as beautiful, but I mean, when I look at the original game and the remake, you can see the damn difference. Not only are the textures, of course, many times better, but the overall change to a third-person perspective has, in my opinion, been excellent. The game will not keep you waiting too long and you will find yourself at the police station in the first hour, where you will also lose more or less the whole game. But you don't have to be afraid. The police station is quite large and it's not surprising. Capcom can squeeze the given location quite well, as we have already shown, for example, in the seventh part in the form of a house. Here, at the police station, you do things that are a classic in the Resident Evil series. You go lost here and there, you collect raw materials, you create healy, you gradually improve your arsenal and there is also an unpleasant solution to puzzles, where I spent an hour solving a puzzle around chess. Resident Evil can do all these elements to number one, but the number two enriched it with one more element and that is Mr. X. A big guy who chases you almost everywhere except the safe room. Once you find it, you can't get rid of it, and the steps you hear while running around the station here and there looking for raw materials, those steps create a great atmosphere and the feeling that you can't stop and that someone is still after you. it goes and it really goes! As soon as Mr. X gets and you have nowhere to run, so you're quite in the fat, because you may not even have a full magazine from a weapon and Resident Evil is one of those games where wasting ammunition is not a good idea and every round is useful. It is best to give headshots to zombies. On Mr. But that's not enough for X and you can only shoot his hat. Although I'm not mistaken for the achievement, which is fine, but Mr. himself. X won't stop and will go after you, and as soon as he's with you, he stretches out and punches you, he can do quite solid damage and you then have to heal and waste your valuable, crimped healing ingredients. All this, meaning that you have few rounds, you have to hit and the fact that Mr. is still after you. X creates quite a lively horror. The only downside to all this is that you have it too fast. Unfortunately, something similar applies to RE as to, say, Call of Duty. It's just short. Personally, I finished the game in about 10 hours in Leon's skin and I was still loitering. (I usually always get lazy: D.) The nice thing is that you can still go through the game behind Claire, who has a slightly different passage, which will extend your gaming experience. The problem is that it still does not save the game from a perfect rating, because not only is the game short, but there is also DLC in it. Such a DLC containing the Original Soundtrack should not be a DLC, but this option should already be in play. On the one hand, I understand that the authors needed to make some money. It is still a remake of a game that is several years old and not everyone will buy the game and would rather wait for a new episode, but the fans of the two who received a remake would, in my opinion, deserve the original soundtrack already in the game, because I personally had this DLC and it spice up the game a lot. Despite the short gameplay and paid DLC, this is one of the best horror movies and especially one of the best remakes I've ever played. Whether you played number two or not, I recommend this game.",Positive

490,resident-evil-2,Ali129,"Jan 10, 2021",9,"1998 yapımı Resident Evil 2'yi oynamamış biri olarak yeniden yapımı oynayıp bitirdim ve oyunun harika olduğunu söylemeliyim. 98 yapımı sürümü oynamadığım için hikaye ve bölüm tasarımı konusunda yeniden yapımın orijinale ne kadar sadık kaldığını bilmiyorum ancak tek başına ele aldığım zaman bu oyunun oldukça başarılı olduğunu söyleyebilirim. Oyunda seçebildiğimiz iki karakter var; Leon Kennedy ve Claire Redfield. Ben oyunu Leon ile bitirdim, Claire ile de bitirecektim ancak hikayesinin birkaç sahne dışında neredeyse Leon ile aynı olduğunu öğrendiğim için vazgeçip Claire'ın hikayesinin farklı bölümlerini internetten izlemeye karar verdim. Oyunun hikayesi biraz kısa, ve hikayenin büyük çoğunluğu karakolda geçiyor bundan dolayı biraz sıkılabilir bazı oyuncular. Ama bölüm tasarımı, vuruş hissiyatı ve grafikleri oldukça güzel. 6-7 saatlik bir oyun için ortalama hikayesi var, normalde bu kadar kısa oyunlarda hikaye anlatımı ve hikayenin kendisi zayıf olur ancak bu oyunda ortalama bir hikaye anlatımını yakalayabilmişler. Oyun kısa sürdüğü için bazen hikayedeki kopukluklar ve aniden gelişen anlamlandıramadığımız olaylar aldığımız keyfi biraz düşürebiliyor. Oyunun kötü karakteri Mr. X de bence iyi bir kötü karakterdi ve aniden duvarı yıkarak karşımıza çıkması veya bize doğru yaklaşırkenki yankılı ayak seslerini duymak güzel bir gerilim kattı oyuna. Oyunun kendisi çok korkutucu değil ancak mekan tasarımları, sesler gerçekten de gerilimli ve bu gerilimi hissetmek güzel. Vuruş hissiyatı konusunda da oyun başarılı, düşmanı vurduğumuzu hissedebiliyoruz ve yeterince güçlü silahlar ile vurduğumuzda düşmanın kafasını veya uzuvlarını koparabiliyoruz, bu da aldığımız keyfi daha da arttırıyor. Oyundaki bulmacalar yer yer sıkabiliyor, bazılarında takıldım ve uzun süre devam edemedim, bazılarını da yapabilmek çok uzun sürdü. Aynı zamanda bir yerden sonra bulmacalar tekrar etmeye başlıyor ve olay daha sıkıcı bir hal alıyor. Grafikleri 1080p yüksek ayarlarda 2019 oyunu için güzel görünüyor, ancak bazı yerlerde kaplama hataları mevcut, bazı dokuların yaklaştığımda yüklenmesi gerekirken yüklenmiyor ve düşük çözünürlükte kalıyor, bu da haliyle kötü görüntüye sebep oluyor. Optimizasyon konusunda genel olarak sistemimle sabit 60 FPS elde edebildim, ancak bazı sahnelerde FPS düşüklüğü ve takılma sorunu oluyordu, onun dışında bir problem yaşamadım. Resident Evil 2 bana kalırsa her oyuncunun oynaması gereken çok güzel bir yapım.",Positive

I am doing a complete run of all the Resident Evil games and as much as I enjoyed the ones leading to this addition to the series, I am thoroughly enjoying RE2 even more. The graphics are exceptional, controls with well enough precision, story compelling, fun additional content, a good assortment of weapons, and zombie butt kicking that measures off the charts with fun. This game has a great deal of replay value, with content and variations that only playing again can you visit and experience. The story continues to expand with each playthrough, up to two runs for each Lean and Claire. Once I completed my play through of all the RE games released, I might find myself back at this one for some zombie crushing fun. The character hopping in mid-story is very enjoyable. The extra segment characters (little girl with Claire and woman with Leon) have skills and play style requirements unique to them, and enjoyably implemented. It took me 3 tries to get the additional achievement for the women, but only 2 for the little girl, apart from the one acquired for completing their segment. Even still, I did them both an extra time after for good measure. I have yet to get a grade of S+, but getting S is relatively easy. The controls are worlds better than RE Zero and RE Original, which is to be expected by the basis of their release. Even so, I find myself enjoying being able to aim and move with a much greater degree of control. The characters animations in these actions are also brilliantly done. In all, Resident Evil 2 is a superb game, and I highly recommend it.

507,resident-evil-2,Padre-Sirius,"Oct 31, 2020",8,"Ажиотаж вокруг этой игры не стихал даже после ее выхода, а учитывая, что данный ремейк называли чуть ли не лучшим за все историю игровой индустрии, обойти стороной этот проект было бы просто кощунством.Сюжет игры неплох и таких людей, как я, ничего не знающих о вселенной «Обители зла», может заинтересовать, и даже пару раз удивить, но не более.Персонажи порадовали, я проходил игру за Леона, а потому про Клэр ничего существенного сказать не могу, но Кеннеди меня порадовал. Не было громких всхлипов о его непростой судьбе, не было долгих размышлений о смысле бытия. Леон просто хотел выжить и по возможности найти виновных. Ада также является довольно колоритным персонажем, который не собирается раскрывать душу перед первым попавшимся человеком. Остальные встречающиеся по сюжету персонажи имеют слишком мало экранного времени, чтобы подвергать их индивидуальному анализу, но все они к месту.Графика очень достойная, как и анимация. Смахивание капель с куртки, разные походки в зависимости от уровня повреждения протагониста и т.д. Все это радует глаз и оставляет приятные впечатления.Геймплей не дает заскучать. Хоть разнообразным его и не назовешь, но постоянные разгадывания загадок вперемешку с защитой своей жизни, могут скрасить не один вечер.По моему скромному мнению, физика оружия, ИИ, локализация и оптимизация не стоят отдельного упоминания, но стоит понимать, что все сделано на довольно высоком уровне, который обеспечивает приятные эмоции во время игры.Отдельно хотелось бы поблагодарить разработчиков за изменения в управлении и перенос камеры за спину протагониста. Возможно, прежним фанатам этой игры данное нововведение показалось лишним, но лично мне оно очень облегчило жизнь, ибо предыдущая камера казалась мне сложноватой в управлении.Но есть и за что поругать данный ремейк. Пугающая атмосфера ужастика, к сожалению, держится очень недолго. Лично в моем случае ее хватило лишь на первые 20-30% игры, после чего я привык и все превратилось в обыкновенный шутер с редкими скримерами, которых порой очень не хватало.

It's a whole reimagination of the 1998 game, that stays true to its original material, but makes it sensible in 2019/2020. It knows that the mysterious world of Raccoon City is gripping enough to make a player really want to solve all its old-school mysteries, even though at any moment another zombie might come out of the corner in search of human flesh. It knows that the real horrors are the ones happening in human brain, and it capitalizes on that perfectly. I hate horror games with all my might but I just couldn't get enough of this one, with its survival elements that add a whole another layer to it.As for any downsides, I wish the gameplay on the 2nd run had more differences at least in the story, so when we put it together it actually starts to make sense, and so it isn't just a iteration of the previously played one.I absolutely loved this game and with this one they've got a new fan in me.",Positive

522,resident-evil-2,SilverOrlov,"Aug 17, 2020",8,"Playing this game for a while, I could tell that I feel the same excitement that ardent fans of the series describe(I only started getting to know RE recently). I was ready to put 10 points for its excellent graphics, high-quality sounds and music, pleasant, exciting sensations from the atmosphere, the habits of the zombies and how they are made... But then I encountered three things that greatly ""over-salting my game dish"":1. Speed ​​... it's just awful. The girl walks and runs slower than a turtle. This is unpleasant in relation to many enemies, but it smooths out the understanding that perhaps this was done to create fear that the zombie is ""breathing down your neck."" But when it comes to large enemies like Tyrant, or slime and the boss of the game, the ""fifth point"" starts to burn when a huge monster running up for you, and you hobble like walking along a park alley, and in a battle with the boss, it is almost impossible to dodge normally , or run away, so as not to receive damage(You meet the main boss on micro-rooms every time, where agility and speed are a critical factor). I believe that those who play at the highest difficult level of the game are the ""game monsters, memorizing every second and every pixel"" of this game. BUT I and general quantity of players are play games for a lot of things, but obviously not to suffer. And obviously not from silly game-play over complications.2. Damage ... I understand that games have different difficulty levels and each has its own rules, such as the amount of resources or the impact of damage from a shot. But in the entire history of the existence of zombies, in books, films, games, one invariable rule has dominated everywhere - ""Shot in the head"". How many bullets do you need to pierce an ordinary person's head? This game thinks that from 3 to the WHOLE CLIP will be enough! ...SERIOUSLY!? According to human logic, an ordinary zombie without a helmet or any other protection is 1 bullet. According to the game logic The simplest zombies are the weakest enemies ... but by any logic - why the hell is a whole clip in the HEAD? ... No matter how the authors or whoever defended this game - for such things there is a highest difficulty level, for those who ""love to suffer"". At the normal level of difficulty, shooting a whole clip (and there will be quite a lot of such zombies) into one single head is insanity, savagery and stupid.3. Too annoying gaming conventions. It is clear that you cannot make perfect game-play with riddles for reality, but the impossibility of jumping a two-meter hole, just for pushing the jack from under the shelf (both things are related to the quest), or the inability to raise your hand and take a tool (and look for a gear for a watches throughout the entire area ), or thin doors, on which you can blow and they will fall, but you need to look for a key half a game - this is stupid. At least draw a heavier door view to make this searching more realistic.Second walk-through: The male police officer walks and runs not faster than the female turtle mentioned above. And if a girl can be blamed on grace and so on, then a guy hobbling into the wreck is just ridiculous. It's funny, but you stop laughing at the last boss fight, where you lose not because of a difficult boss, but because of stupid slow legs.The first 45% of the game are the same locations as before, only from a different angle(a couple of new rooms and corridors). The last 45% of the game are generally identical to the first walk-through, excluding scanty plot details. Only in the middle the 10% of the game does something change so that it would be possible to justify overplaying - this is both a new zone and a game for the sexy babe ""hacker"". But in general, we can say that the plot, yes, in many ways shows a different picture. Only this does not raise the assessment because: Firstly, it does not cover a bunch of hours spent on identical 90% of the game-play, Secondly, part of the plot twists confuses the brain: it seems to be the same story, but for a different character, but it seems would have the same enemies in the same places (for example, the same fight with the use of a hanging container).... This will not affect the rating, but I did not like the additions about the survivors at all: each of them very strongly pushes the player forward, throwing enemies from all the holes. Strongly-strongly-strongly for the fans.",Positive

530,resident-evil-2,primalsmash,"Jul 10, 2020",7,"This game was made artificially difficult. It is just know how, you can't know what is ahead to plan for future and without making near perfect decisions you won't make it. 90% of game is dodging zombies, which is just trial and error. Or to know where to go next and what to do first. Because you don't have almost any ammo. So you can't waste any shots! There are puzzles and hidden things, you won't be able to find stuff and solve puzzle, while being chased - perfectly! Which leads inevitably to save scumming! Play game normally, than watch walkthrough of same scenario: replay the scenario. I guarantee you will have 0 problems and finish game almost instantly. It is just you can't see future and you won't be able to progress, until you play that part of the game well. So first you will need to figure where to go, what to do and solve puzzle and than probably, you will need to reload to the last save and now you know what to do you can finish that almost perfectly. But for the first time , it is nearly impossible... You won't know all tricks and stuff, which you can find out only by trial and error and that's really frustrating. Average joe will finish game like in 50 hours... Dying 100 times, before figuring out puzzle while being chased or something. Fortunately, there are unlimited ammo weapons in Deluxe Edition. So you can play normally and use them when needed. It is still great game, but frustrating af and for masochists. Because if you don't play well, you will end up unable to being finish rest of the game, so you will need to play near perfectly, until you are able to save game again... And most frustrating is, it is not even difficult. But you need to know how, which you can't know until you test it by trial and error. My head hurts just thinking about how stupid this is... Play game and than read tips, you will be like face palm. Like zombie dodging method, no one could know, that you found that randomly by trial and error aaaaaaaaaaarrrrggghhhhhhhhh.... Also there is high input lag, it is one of these games, which were made primarily on console.

I'm happy to say that I couldn't be more wrong. The game looks and sounds amazing. The puzzles, although quite simple, were still enjoyable. They made the guns feel like they pack a punch while also making zombies hard to kill, avoiding the pitfall of making the guns feel like they're shooting pellets.

545,resident-evil-2,Baltifru,"Apr 19, 2020",10,"First thing first: this remake of Resident Evil 2 is a masterpiece. This episode gathers the two best elements of the saga: 1) the atmosphere. It's neither the pure action of RE4/5/6 (although I love RE4) nor the permanent terror of RE7. It is this thrilling anxiety, that plays with the perfect light and sound effects, this stress of not knowing what's gonna be behind this wall corner... Unlike RE7, jump scares are scarce, but this leaves room for this more subtle anxiety accompanying the player at every step. 2) the ""over-the-shoulder"" view. Yes, I also kinda like the good old fixed angles sometimes but mostly because of nostalgia. This episode brillantly proves that you can have a flexible third person view and yet keep the core aspects of the game, i.e. the atmosphere and the survival. Game Design: perfect All aspects of the design are thought as a survival: apart from the classical limited inventory and reduced ammo compared to the number of mobs, the new elements of the gameplay greatly contribute. You'll discover it is sometimes surprisingly hard to hit a zombie, because the aim has an important spread unless you stand still for a few seconds, but also because zombie moves are erratic. Props to Capcom for managing to design zombies moves that both make them feel like real zombies, and serve the gameplay by making them hard to hit. The other mobs appearing later in the game also contribute to the great game design. Lickers, especially, are a crucial point of the gameplay, as they practically force you to walk (instead of running) in some areas. When you enter a corridor with a licker, zombies, and Mr.X running after you, the adrenaline rises... and you understand how well the game is designed. Level Design: awesome Speaking of design, this is a trait of the RE series: the level design of the police station (I'll talk later about the other places) is awesome. The map is huge, the layout of the keys, locked doors and other objects is thought to keep the player both tense and curious to progress at every single point of the game. You have to visit multiple times some areas (but usually it's because you got a new key, and your perspective on this area changes), and you can ignore some others that contain only ""bonuses"". But what is great is that the level design is so well thought that visiting these bonus areas is not just a matter of being a completist or not. Reaching them sometimes means having to overcome zombies, lickers or worse, and the risk and the ammo consumption this represents must be put in the balance together with the potential gains, making your choices highly strategical. And if you think the level desing is only ""good"", wait for when Mr. X comes into play. You will realise that the position of the doors leading from one wing of the police station to the other, the size of the corridors, the position of the lickers... everything is thought also to make the hunt with Mr. X one of the tensest moments the game. Mr. X He deserves his own paragraph. The cat-and-mouse game with Mr. X is to me the climax of the game. I don't want to spoil too much, but his AI is really good, his walking pace is very well calibrated to reinforce the fear he inspires, and the noise of his steps are both a source of stress and a key element to play the game around him. I just have one regret: there are a couple of rooms where he is programmed not to go. I know the game design was already complex enough not to have to think of how he could interfere with the player when dealing with a puzzle, but knowing there is a room nearby where he never goes kinda releases the anxiety of having him around sometimes. Yet, I repeat: this was for me the best moment of the game, the core of what is survival-horror. A few cons though... 1) Just like RE0, and I would dare to say a bit like RE1 as well: the quality of the level design decreases as the game goes further. Of course, it is difficult to rival the level design of the police station, but the levels of the sewers and the NEST are far more linear and predictable in my opinion. No more room with 10 doors with 3 different key symbols, but mostly long linear corridors and the end of which you know in advance which key you will find. The level design there is not bad per se : it is just a little underwhelming after spending a few hours in the police station. 2) Again, just like the other episodes of Resident Evil, the scenario is full of promises in the first hours of the game, but as you progress through the game, you realise that not much more than the few core, predictable elements are revealed, with no big twist, no little detail hidden here and there to look after in the next episodes... a little disappointing. This remake of Resident Evil 2 was arguably one of the most anticipated games in the last years, and although it is difficult to match the expectations when they're so high, Capcom did it brillantly.

You can complete the true ending, that is Leon and Claire's play through in like 16 hours and that is first time not know where anything is.

No solo hay que buscar X item en lugares ultra imbéciles como el componente electrónico en el campanario, si no que también hay que resolver un puzzle.. o sea todo se resume a encontrar y resolver, encontrar y resolver, es estúpido. -Si no jugaste al original es probable que en un principio no sepas que son y de donde vienen las criaturas de las alcantarillas (algo que no pasaba en el original). -No recrea de ninguna manera la atmósfera que generaba el original... la banda sonora esta ausente. Si me pongo a pensar, seguro que le sigo encontrando defectos, estos son los que recuerdo ahora. -Un juego decente, pero no es la remake que un juego tan legendario como RE2 merece.",Negative

556,resident-evil-2,SamuNN,"Apr  4, 2020",10,"Holy **** I never got into RE before as it wasn't my type of game. Boy I was wrong, this is a masterpiece. I'll cut this review into 3 parts: 1. Gameplay2. Story3. Replayability Gameplay:The gunplay in the game is extremely solid, with a great sense of survival horror. Tight inventory management, scarce ammo drops, zombies being hard to kill, etc. This all adds up with a great atmosphere especially in the RPD, the true star of the game. What helps making this atmosphere even more frightening is the music and sound design, while music isn't always there, the sound of zombies and their footsteps echoing through the halls are excellent. The lickers are back in full force, with these very tense moments when you sneak right past them. And of course, how can we forget Mr. X? This giant dude is gonna make you poop your pants. He's not really scary on his own, what does make him scary is his omnipresence throughout a part of the story, you can constantly hear his footsteps in the background coming closer and closer to you, so good. The boss fights, while not numerous, are very well executed. Birkin and his G-Virus are back in full force, he's been given so much love. These boss fights are tense and hard, as it's supposed to be with RE, scrambling for resources and making sure you can kill the boss and survive with the resources you have is such a good feeling. Definitely something they nailed. The game looks absolutely amazing, like wow, this **** look good. Story:RE2 follows both Leon S. Kennedy, a rookie police officer and Claire Redfield in the harrowing journey through Raccoon City. There are A and B scenarios for both Leon and Claire, which follow each other like so, Leon A --> Claire B (not canon) and Claire A --> Leon B (canon). Both these story's in there A and B scenarios respectively are amazing, even though you do play mostly the same game, with a few minor differences (the side character of each story, Sherry for Claire and Ada for Leon). There's still some janky dialogue, mostly because they stayed true to the 1998 original. Also some cut content, but nothing that feels like there is something missing in the game. Overall, my first playthrough (Leon A) was about 8 hours long, add in all the other story's I ended up with 20 hours of story gameplay. Very good. Replayability:This game begs you to play it again on higher difficulty and with a better score, so you can unlock more stuff. You get infinite guns and challenge yourself to play the game like a real pro. There's definitely a lot of things to do in this game. Not to mention all of the extra DLC you get! The Ghost Survivors are a great addition that expand on the story of the game and give some insight as to what happened before or after you get to that point in Leon or Claire's story. You also unlock the 4th survivor mode once you finish the game, where you play as Hunk trying to escape RC with limited time and resources, such an adrenaline rush that gamemode was! The extra's in the menu is also super fun to look at. My final verdict: 10/10This remake is a masterpiece and sets the bar high for every remake Capcom is planning to make in this series, can't wait for RE1 to be remade like this!",Positive

559,resident-evil-2,Pedro_Batista91,"Mar 28, 2020",10,"Esse jogo é simplesmente perfeito. Resident Evil 2 Remake consegue trazer todos os elementos de survival horror que conhecemos lá na segunda metade dos anos 90, aliado aos melhores elementos da atual geração, o jogo fica mais empolgante ainda quando mudamos para a trilha sonora original, dando aquele ar de nostalgia para quem viveu e jogou o Resident Evil 2 lá em 1998. A CAPCOM acertou em cheio com esse jogo, não dá vontade de parar de jogar, e vale salientar que, o jogo está muito bem otimizado, esse jogo é só qualidade, não vi nenhum defeito nessa maravilha. quem dá nota baixa ou 'não recomendo', simplesmente não tem coração, kkk Quando vejo uma nota 88 no metacritic, vejo o quanto esses novos ""reviewers"" são frescos ou querem que todo jogo tenha 40min. de cutscene e 10min. de gameplay, ou certamente é aquele saudosista que vive batendo na tecla de câmera fixa. Esse jogo está impressionante a cada ponto do mapa que você visita, dando aquela impressão: Eu já passei por esse lugar. Não tem como não se impressionar com a beleza gráfica da RE Engine e o clima de terror como há muito tempo não sentíamos na série Resident Evil em 3ª pessoa, pois o RE7 já conseguiu resgatar o survival que conhecemos lá em 2017. Esse jogo será o Game Of The Year de 2019, os jogos que serão lançados ao longo do ano, terá que ser excelentes para ter a mesma qualidade do Resident Evil 2. Espero muito que a CAPCOM continue nessa ascendente, pois seus últimos jogos são excelentes, e já fico na ansiedade de ver RE3, Dino Crisis, RE: Outbreaks e Operation Raccoon City (ORC que teve uma boa ideia, mas uma péssima execução) na RE Engine, mas o mais provável que aconteça, é a vinda do Resident Evil 8, que também fico na ansiedade.",Positive

561,resident-evil-2,loevenbalk,"Mar 24, 2020",8,"Resident Evil 2 is quite a gem. An unexpected one for me as I'm not normally one for survival, shooters, or horror so you can imagine I was quite surprised to find such a compelling experience in this remake of a two-decade old game. Since I picked this up I've completed the game a handful of times and my latest attempts scored me an S+ on the hardest difficulty with both playable characters; Leon Kennedy and Claire Redfield. Now, as someone who isn't a diehard fan of the series let me just say this: Dropping the tank controls and fixed camera angles that I remember from the oldest entries in the series was the move that convinced me to give this a shot. From there what developed was a bit of rollercoaster in terms of my enjoyment. I was immediately enjoying the action, the gore, the gritty and dark nature of the setting. As an adult male I really shouldn't have a problem with the dark - but this game gave me one. I couldn't bring myself to play this game solo in the dark, and at one point I even had my brother play for an hour or two with me just so I could make some progress. The gunplay was and is what reels me into this game every time I boot it up. It is just so satisfying to shoot zombies in their stupid faces and to feel like you're permanently removing an obstacle that is in your way. I've never personally shot a gun in my life, but everything about shooting one in RE2 feels satisfying. You cannot imagine the shameless glee you feel not just the first time but everytime you 'crown' a zombie, which is when you score a critical headshot that makes their heads explode in a mess of blood and gore. Parts of your developing arsenal allow for a higher success rate than others with this, but even the first weapon the game hands you has the potential to trigger this effect. Part of the reason for my slightly conservative scoring of this game that I've now drawn hours and hours of entertainment from is a selection of elements that may well be agreeable to you. I know that my issue with one particular enemy in this game is one that most people will find inspiring and an inviting challenge. So I personally deduct a few points for the elements of this game that excluded me from enjoying it for a while. The horror and the cheap jumpscares weren't as much of a problem as I perhaps made them out to sound like initially. While they did get me to put the game down for days and even weeks, they wouldn't prove problematic in the long run. I eventually overcame them and in retrospect I can enjoy them for what they want to be on the first few times you come across them. The biggest road block to my personal progress with the game came about a third or halfway through. One particular enemy is introduced that immediately changes the game from what can be a slow strategical uncovering of the map and all of its features to a frantic chase for the next solution to whatever puzzle is currently gating your advance. If you are a veteran of the series and the genre, I'm sure you didn't have my reaction to this but I simply quit the game and didn't touch it again for a few months. I was trying to figure the game out on my own, and being as new as I was to working under pressure in the way that only true survival horror can deliver I couldn't deal with the steamrolling of my otherwise functional strategy of playing it safe and slow. I barely had an understanding of the map, so adding a constant and ever-present threat was enough to have me give up. So how was the game salvaged for me, and not just that but turned into such a playground again that I ended up completing the game on the hardest difficulty? Well, memes were my rescue. Months into what I thought was my final dismissal of the game I came across a set of memes that ridiculed this one enemy type that washed away my fears. Suddenly, I felt an itch for the game again. And whenever I came across this enemy I would regurgitate this meme telling myself that I would be fine, and that really it was just another puzzle to solve. One that wasn't even the timer that I once saw it as, but rather a puzzle in motion that could become predictable through study. Finally, I am not a fan of campy elements in story telling. I prefer a focus on maintaining immersion rather than delivering fourth wall breaks. I appreciate realistic and relatable characters over stereotypical charicatures. Now, I know that Resident Evil has had elements of camp all along, so I'm not raking RE2 over the coals for something that surprised me in any way. It just detracted from my experience, and one character in particular is so loaded with this problem that it overflows. This was the second point of this game that made me put down the controller and skip it for a while. But this IS a game worth a look whether you are new like me or a seasoned vet. Now I look forward to seeing what Capcom does with the sequel.",Positive

Resident Evil 2 is a stellar example of remakes done right, taking classic locales and events of the old, but rejuvenating and adding the new to make a game that paradoxically feels both nostalgic and fresh. It somehow gives you the ultimate way of experiencing the story, yet I still feel the original to be fantastic in its own right; this game has not detracted from the original in any way. Incredible graphics from an impressive engine, fantastic refreshes of character models, with great voice work to accompany, and all the classic bells and whistles that come with the post game, make it replayable again and again.",Positive

Há tempos um jogo não me prende assim, principalmente quando se trata de campanha. Os gráficos são lindíssimos.  Reflexos, texturas, modelo dos personagens, tudo aqui é muito bem feito, e o melhor: é incrivelmente otimizado. Meu setup empurrava +100fps em todos os momentos, e para não ter uma experiencia ruim no meu 144hz, travei em 100 e não tive problemas de fluidez pelo resto do game. Fluidez insana e nada de quedas! A gameplay é bem travada. Apenas atacamos com armas de fogo, exceto em situações de contato, e é esse mesmo o objetivo do jogo.

I know I know, it comes from an era when games have been that way but still, I had hoped Capcom had added some additional content. The second run is never my style since I hate to replay games as soon as i finished them. I know it has some different parts and slightly different story but all in all it has a lot of the scenery recycled.

600,resident-evil-2,Sholva,"Oct  2, 2019",10,"Resident Evil 2 is one of the best examples on how to properly remake a 20 year old classic bestselling game, by embracing what worked back in the day, see what could be improved and also adding a lot, and I mean really a lot, of new stuff so it still feels interesting and fresh, but also leaving the player with a feeling of familiarity, especially if one has played the original game. The RE Engine has proven to be very well performing on its previous game, RE 7, and this time around in RE 2 it really shines. We have a very nice Physically Based Rendered assortment of materials and shaders, with a lot of wet surfaces that look amazing, and performance is really, really good on a wide array of PC configurations, with a decent level of scalability, especially on the GPU side of things. The engine seems to make decent usage of 4-6 core CPUs, but it’s usually GPU limited, which normally is the ideal situation when it comes to good looking PC games. The amount of customizable settings we have in this PC version of the game is also immense, from FOV adjustments to nice mouse sensitivity sliders for camera and aim modes (although there is a slight amount of negative acceleration, very little), and keybinds are mostly fully customizable with the exception of a couple of hardcoded keys like ENTER or DEL; I am left handed, so I use the right side of the keyboard a lot, around the arrow keys (used for movement), so I was able to play with no issues with my usual left handed binds, minus DEL and ENTER but the game doesn’t really need so many keys, so I managed. Gamepad works fine in the game, you can walk slower with it than with the keyboard, in case you need a little more immersion, but it’s not mandatory. There’s this bug I guess that makes it impossible to open doors when in aiming mode, walking with the keyboard, while you can when using the gamepad, but it’s not game breaking and you can still walk normally without aiming, open it a little, then switch to aim mode and It’ll get pushed slowly if you want, so no big deal there either. An important thing to note about settings is Brightness calibration, you must abolutely do the steps to calibrate this, if you want the game to look as the developers intended, otherwise it'll have this grey'ish haze all over the screen, and dark zones won't look good enough. If you cannot complete the third step on the calibration menu (make the left typewriter disappear), that means you either didn't select the proper MIn/Max levels earlier, or your screen needs some serious tuning and adjusting of brightness and gamma, so better get on that then too. And then we have the new gameplay mechanics, like knives and other sub-weapons, the new puzzles and the revamp of old classic ones, which will certainly make you smile, and of course the new way of doing the classic A/B runs, in this case called “2nd run”, which like the original game, it will tell us the story from the other character’s perspective, around the same time the other character did his/her stuff, more or less, with some clever variations added so the gameplay feels balanced but still challenging enough. In summary, to fully complete the story, we still need to do both scenarios, whether Leon first / Claire second, or vice versa…that’s your choice. Completionists will want to do all four of them, and the game records all these different combinations so yeah, it’s nice that the feature is still there, albeit a bit different. Of course, the main change from the original, is the camera and I have to say it really fits this new imagining of the game, it simply works well, really well actually and in a fully rendered 3D world with lots of cool materials and very detailed enemies to mutilate and shoot, it would've been bad if the old fixed camera was used, or the tank controls too, which usually work well together but not so much when separated like it was the case in RE 4. Overall this game feels like a very solid GOTY candidate so early in the year, which is amazing. This game has become one of my favorite RE games of all time, because it demonstrates that the survival horror genre, which the original games were paragon of, can still be brought to modern platforms, with improved techniques, amazing sound design (and boy, is the sound design great here, it even has Dolby Atmos and Binaural…really great), and new ways of solving old puzzles or see them reimagined. I am ready for more Resident Games like this, Capcom, thank you for the great job on this game, made for the fans of survival horror, and for the gamers in general.

But I never had a chance to finish the game, because I was too scared to play. This time I was an adult, I was ready, it was the remastered version. And for the first time in a decade, I found NOTHING to complain about. This game is a masterpiece. They simply followed the story, remastered the game with new graphics and modern features like the following camera and so on.Good job. This is what I expect from the remastered games. If you doubt whether to experiment, just follow the old pattern. And you win.",Positive

611,resident-evil-2,greenisgood,"Jul 22, 2019",9,"Just Finished This game and I could not wait to shout it's praises from the high heavens. I was itching for an experience that RE 2 provided me and then some. First things first 'Claire FTW...' I feel I enjoyed Claire's second run play through a bit more than Leon's, but I am certain it was because of the grenade launcher as Claire felt like an absolute bad ass, rightly so being the sister of Chris. Kinda makes sense.This game did for me in regards to Claire what RE 4 did in regards to Leon. i.e; made me love Claire and recognize her as a strong character.This is not saying Leon's Campaign was any less of a positive experience in itself, since I did not know what to expect around the next turn during the entirety of my first run, I had knots in my stomach. Really really fun knots.Capcom was in a bit of a slump but seem to be making a much needed comeback in the past few years. Please Give me more of THIS Capcom.... Experiences like the one RE 2 Remake provides is one of the reasons I fell in Love with Gaming. It feels legendary. Though one small gripe I have is both Leon and Claire's Play through is, it is more of their own thing rather than two sides of the same coin. I would have loved to see both the First and Second Run intertwine more,  with our protagonists to meet/run into each other than cut-scenes and a proper parallel story line. The interconnecting stories and how it affected the world was the only thing I actually liked from RE 6 and it should have been carried over here.But as I said it is a minor nitpick in the face of the absolute gorgeous visuals, competent story line and downright amazing game play I have experienced. An absolute Gem of a beloved classic.",Positive

621,resident-evil-2,thebilgekhan,"May 23, 2019",9,"A Great Remake, such a nostalgia. I've first played this game with my uncle when I was 5. Now seeing it remaked, it's so much fun. Firstly I loved how they integrated the RE 4's shoulder view to the characters. I think it's best to demonstrate the gameplay to the player now. So many details in the models. Graphic engine is really smooth, detailed and optimized. Loved the variations of the zombies (if I'm not wrong 12 different male zombies and 4 female ones, which is a great detailing.) Loved the model depart system applied to the zombies so  that the limbs can fall with each shot. Leon looks a little bit like a puppy with his voice. Claire also looks good but a little bit chubby on the cheekbones. I'm just critizing these for a better visual/performance. I think Leon and Claire should share more moments and cooperate more in the gameplay, yet if we play second-run it automatically ignores the first run for the other character, which is odd. I think Ada should have more role in the game since we will not be able to see her soon. They really put some great effort in her and she looks great in this remake. My first play was long (about 10 hours). I have tried to investigate everyplace and confused going to the places to solve the problems in the map so I had to go over like 3-4 times in my first run. The other runs were pretty faster for me, except the different riddles. (My last run was about 2 hours) Anyway, I think it's a little bit short game but still loved the visual greatness, the nostalgia, iconic characters coming back to life again such as Leon, Claire and Ada, also seeing Mr.X was great. Looking forward to the next game. CAPCOM did such a fantastic job with the whole models, textures, game engine, gameplay, mocaps (especially for the storytelling). They screwed things up in RE 6 but I think they put some effort and tried to fix their sins in the recent games such as RE7. I hope to play RE 3 Remake and RE 8 when they come out. Well done.",Positive

629,resident-evil-2,21grams,"Apr 21, 2019",7,"It's decent game and decent remake, but sadly it's a bit boring and tedious and combat is just not great. Basically the story could be written in 3 sentences - it's extremely short. The game is then extended by forcing you to run back and forth for keys and similar things that enable you moving to the next area, rinse and repeat while not adding to the story at all in between - which makes game drag and feel tedious and boring a lot of the time. The we have combat which is just piss poor bullet sponge shooting range. If upgrades shotgun at point blank doesn't always blow the head off for basic zombie - it says it all and basic handgun - oh boy - it's 5-8 headshots to kill anything.. Then there are few bosses which also suck - but it's hard to describe them without spoilers - all I can tell you basically kite them around loading all ammo you have into them to then execute in a silly way - because someone thought it's fun but IT'S NOT. The game is very atmospheric and climatic (but sadly not scary at all) overall and brings back that old school game nostalgia, but sorry - it's not 10/10 or even 8/10. Anyone saying that way is straight up lying to your face because he is massive fanboy of RE series most likely. It's not bad game, but it's not as amazing as others say.

The way you will feel how you get stronger and stronger because of the inventory you are getting through the story, how you go on opening different paths and connecting them making shortcuts, the boss fights.

И мои ожидания полностью оправдались.Игра великолепна. Всё в ней прекрасно от геймплея до графики. Атмосферные локации, хорошая проработка уровней до самых мелочей, реалистичная, будто взятая из видео внешность персонажей, объемные звуки, экшен и чуть ужаса - всё это определенно присутствует в этом переиздании.Игра не дает расслабиться, почувствовать себя в безопасности. Даже некогда, как мы думаем, точки сохранения, где мы уверены, что не получим какого-то вреда, становятся такими же опасными; как и все остальные помещения. Привет, Тиран, Марвин!В игре так же имеются загадки, без прохождения которых вы не двинетесь дальше по сюжету. Они не сложные, логичные и вполне решаемые, не с первого раза, так точно со второго или третьего.Самой интересной локацией для меня стала самая первая - полицейский участок. Он действительно соответствовал хорору. Дальше всё покатилось больше к перестрелкам, но это отнюдь не минус. Появлялось новое оружие, новые монстры.Наиграв 10 часов, я закончила компанию за Леона и сразу же перешла к компании Клэр. И тут началось разочарования...Из-за которых я не смогла поставить максимальный балл этой игре. Компания за Клэр начинается точно так же как из-за Леона, я знаю, что дальше будет ответвление, которое будет разительным образом отличаться от компании за Леона, но начало такое же и загадки тоже. Это меня расстроило и я уже не посчитала интересным проходить компанию за Клэр.Дополнительные режимы, сделанные разработчиками разнообразны и даже драматичны. Они привносят еще положительных эмоций от игры.В общем, все мои ожидания оправдались. Я получила то, что хотела: красавчика Леона с прокачанной моделькой, текстурами. Я насладилась сюжетом, его поворотами и любовной линией. Определенно, игра доставила мне удовольствие.В общем 9 Леонов из 10.Теперь ждем ремастер 3 части, либо вообще, 8 часть.ありがとうございます、Capcom.",Positive

I haven't played the original from 1998 but saw improvements in YouTube videos. I love the graphics and the gameplay in 3rd person a lot. The sounds were very well done and the zombies were frightening in the first playthrough.I like what they did with records and the rewards for completing them. Concept art pieces look awesome and of course after speedrunning it over 16 times, playing with infinite weapons every now and then is also quite fun. Literally, the only reason the score isn't a 10 is that I wasn't a huge fan of the dlc's  Ghost Survivors. I liked the stories and all but not the gameplay. Wasn't my favorites to be honest, however, I liked playing AS those characters. Another big + for me is the fact that modding is a thing in the game, making sure the community is involved in creating extra content. For example, being able to play as Jill replacing the Claire model or Mr.X being replaced by a S.T.A.R.S repeating Nemesis. I just love that. Also quite a few jokes in there like the beach versions for Leon and Mr.X. The game is solid and scared me in the first few playthroughs and still sometimes gets me when the zombies have moved to ''not arranged'' positions and just pop up.",Positive

The game is not about the zombie Apocalypse.The game is about collecting pots of flowers, opening safes and cabinets. Plus it can be noted poor inventory game made for just trolling players. Personally, I cursed the developers a million times for something that is out of habit clicked the right button of the mouse on the objects that provoked the exit of the equipment( in any normal game, right click the mouse on the item displays the properties of objects and actions).

675,resident-evil-2,TheGoldenEmprah,"Feb 24, 2019",4,"A style over substance game that completely phones in story consequences. A and B scenarios make so little difference between the characters, playing them in reverse order needed a bonus weapon just to differentiate them. Also going back to ""if you don't have a weapon you're defenseless"" era gameplay? Even in RE1 you could still stomp a zombie that bit your legs on the head. And by god does breakable melee weapons feel arbitrary, do they make them out of cheese? Losing knives defensively is one thing, but when they break after a few deft thrusts into a rotting corpses melon? And finally, RNG guns. Look, i get you want people to feel the survival in survival horror, actually weigh up whether running or gunning is the better option and actually make them feel somewhat powerless. But a gun that can blast open a zombies skull in a single shot, then takes 15 on the next zombie? It starts ruining suspension of belief. Either make it so area damage is consistent, or that you need to overcome regeneration. RNG is just immersion breaking. Otherwise the game brings nothing new to the table. It's literally just a graphics update with content altered or removed entirely. At least Hunk and Tofu are back though. Oh and immediate minus points for day one DLC and pre order bonus'; they're cancer and need to stop. Visuals are a part of the experience too. So carving out costumes so you can wring a few extra dollars from fans is poo tier behavior. The only reason the game doesn't score lower, is mechanically, the game is solid; no stupid bugs or broken content. (that i found anyway) This is how a game should be released. I'd score it higher for that alone if it weren't for the fact that this is how it should be normally.

In this remake, tank controls are trashed for the more immersive over-the-shoulder view, but zombies are far more resilient, and can stream in periodically from broken windows.  No room feels safe.  No amount of ammo feels like it's enough.  Whether you played the original or not, the feeling is preserved.  Some scares happen exactly as they did in 98; some don't. I miss the character zapping from the original, and to be honest, the classic sound effects, music and menu effects should have came in the box rather than being DLC.

В 2015 году догадки подтвердились официальным заявлением. Далее 4 года я как только мог ""облизывал"" каждую обнародаванную информацию - как фанатские слухи, так и от официальных источников. После трейлера и геймплейных видео демки, показанных на E3-2018 - стало более-менее ясно, чего нам ждать, но из-за камеры а-ля 4-ка ко мне подкрадывался скепсис. И... этот скепсис вмиг развеялся, когда вышла игра!Смена камеры от статичной в ""от плеча"" вообще никак не испортило атмосферу из классики - тут не в камере дело, а в самом процессе: опять решаем головоломки, опять один простой зомби может представлять большую угрозу, опять надо бегать от сундука к сундуку, опять нужно думать головой - где, например, безопаснее будет пройти из точки А в точку Б. Кто-то скажет, что Тиран тут внушает не страх, а только надоедает, но я скажу - чтобы ощутить всю безысходность - не просто нужно, а вообще необходимо проходить на хардкоре, где все враги опасны, а свинца они жрут много. Я это говорю к тому, что побег от Тирана может случайно завершиться в узком коридоре с лизунами, которых в ремейке, в отличие от оригинала, вообще нельзя трогать, дабы не отправиться к праотцам. Помимо всего прочего очень понравились некоторые отсылки к прототипу второго Резика - Resident Evil 1.5 (кто знает - тот поймёт). В-общем, эта игра может не понравиться только уж совсем страдающим синдромом утёнка, для которых и Ада не та, и Леон с Клер, и участок, и так далее.

690,resident-evil-2,ThePluckyBrit,"Feb 18, 2019",10,"A noobs experience with the seminal survival horror. I'll admit, I missed out on the Resident Evil craze first time round, I was never one for scaring myself and a sufferer of arachnophobia, neither conducive to playing a game like Resi.My first foray was 5, the action Resi, I played it all the way through in Co-Op, twice, and loved it.6 never grabbed me.. my first experience with what I consider my first real survival horror came with The Evil Within, a game I feel is criminally underated, it gave me a taste for the genre and led me to play both EW2 and Resi 7, both excellent experiences treading the fine line between scares and thrills and keeping me engaged like few other genres can manage. On hearing that Resi 2 was being remade I was quite excited, with one large caveat, if I was gonna be facing RE engine spiders I was out...thankfully they were removed and I jumped in on release day. I was surprised to see a capcom game so well optimised and catered for on the PC, it ran beautifully at 4k maxed always maintaining a solid 60fps (RTX2080TI FE). I did not encounter a single bug during my 24 hours of playtime. Very impressive, and nice to see. Gameplay wise, this is another wonderful experience, I jumped straight in to my first play through with Leon, and enjoyed the relatively slow build up to tougher enemies and the sense of exploration and wtf moments you encounter as you get to know the Racoon City PD. I finished that first play through in around 14 hours which is longer then most but I am quite cautious and methodical in my play style. The game finished quite abruptly but to a  satisfactory conclusion, I loved every minute with perhaps the only negative being the repetition of the relatively small game location, this is subjective however as I think it is also intentional, as with 7 the locations are a character all their own and getting to know them well can aid you in the later stages of the game. Before setting out on the initial play through, i was aware that many claimed you needed to play both Leon and Claire to experience the whole story, I was sceptical of this, and rarely retread games, especially without a long break in between, in the case of this game however as soon as my Leon (A) credits rolled I logged straight back in as Claire and was impressed with how differently the game plays when using her, locations are largely the same, with a couple of notable exceptions, but the order of events and enemies you face change up quite a bit, creating a fresh experience even on the second run. I finished up Claire's run with 24 hours total gameplay time and loved every single minute, I also received a more complete ending tying in both characters to the final scenes. A truly memorable gaming experience and one I may even go back to in a year or so and try the free ghost survivors DLC that capcom has, once again surprisingly provided free of charge to players. One of my favourite games of recent memory and a likely contender for my personal game of the year, even at this early stage and it comes highly recommended.",Positive

The relationship between main and secondary characters was forced and rushed. For instance, Leon meets a japanese woman in the sewers full of monsters and kiss her. This is weird and makes no sense. Another point is that the puzzles was too easy; I personally think that should have more complex puzzles, and not just 'pick a key and unlock the door that contains another key that unlock another door'.",Positive

699,resident-evil-2,rubanovmike,"Feb 13, 2019",10,"We've been waiting for such a game to come out in a long time, and the moment has finally come! I am so glad that Capcom released this game. Unfortunately, I did not have the benefit of playing the original game because I wasn't born at that time. But the moment I saw the ad pop up on my Steam store page, I knew that buying this game would be the right decision. And now, after playing all four different campaigns and going through the two extra modes (the 4th survivor and the tofu survivor), I can fully say that there wasn't a nanosecond I regretted buying the game.It's a true survival horror game, not an action-packed piece of trash stuffed with unrealistic overpowered main characters that can punch boulders into lava and shoot down huge mutated opponents while running and avoiding different obstacles at the same time. You have to control the amount of ammo you are carrying with you, you have to know all the hazards and dangers of going into a certain room, you have to know the ways in which you can defeat or avoid different opponents, such as lickers or Tyrant.The atmosphere of the game is what makes it so terrifying and unique. Going into the eastern part of RPD station was rather challenging and mentally difficult for me the first half of the game. And everything got especially tough whenever I had to quietly pass by lickers, as a single step made while running can cause them to instantly attack you and turn you into a bag of bones and muscles.Oh my Gosh, I cannot describe how much I love the music in this game. My two favorite tracks are ""Expansion"" (which plays during Claire's lab escape scenario) and ""Looming Dread"" (Hunk's theme). The music makes the game more dynamic and fast-paced.I can go on and on forever, that is why I am going to leave the rest of explanation to the people who played the original Resident Evil 2. I am trying to speak from the perspective of someone for whom the game is a totally fresh experience.Capcom, thank you very much for releasing this game!",Positive

703,resident-evil-2,PrimalBanana,"Feb 10, 2019",9,"Resident Evil is a series that passed me by when I was a kid and the series was at its peak. I played one of the early games back in the day but never finished it because I struggled with the controls and camera. I decided to try out Resident Evil 2 because I saw a playthrough on YouTube and I’m glad I did.The game has received a massive Graphical overhaul and although it stays true to the original game there is a whole new section and monster to deal with whilst the tension and atmosphere feel fresh. I’ve never played a game with such a sense of hopelessness before as my resources dwindle. You can play through RE2 with either Leon or Claire and whilst both playthroughs will take place in the same setting there are differences to each. It’s well worth playing through both possibly multiple times. Zombies are very well done in RE2 as are the rest of the monster roster with varying degrees of difficulty and ways of bringing them down. The quiet moments of the game get your heart pounding as you edge your way through the darkness. The narrative is well done and whilst it maintains some of the cheesiness of the originals it feels very up to date in this remake.RE2 look stunning. The dark areas are proper dark, and the map is filled with detail. The animations are fluid and believable and the map in general just feels believable. The puzzles are meaningful and the added stress of worrying about the resident ghoulies really sees you making some funny errors even in the simplest of tasks. The 3rd person camera feels great and the character models nicely detailed. Performance wise RE2 never put a foot wrong.Playthrough on the normal difficulty took me between 7 and 8 hours for each character and I definitely see replay value as I am sure I’ll be playing through again. Capcom show here how a remake should be done and I hope they give some of their other games similar treatment.",Positive

708,resident-evil-2,Dorkus,"Feb  8, 2019",10,"First things first, let's get this out of the way. This game is a remake, not a remaster. A remaster would be the game just given a new coat of paint and maybe some fixes to bugs...maybe some additional content, however, this is not that. This is a remake, it is a reimagining of the original game with new gameplay elements introduced, maybe even new areas added or slight changes to the overall story. Now, into the specifics, this game is incredible. It has me hooked as no other Resident Evil game has ever had me hooked before. I have played Resident Evil HD and Resident Evil 7 in the past, and, while I found those to be enjoyable, for some reason they just never really clicked with me. This game clicked with me, and I am addicted. The more I play this game, the more I want to play. It took me a bit of time to ease into this game. I've never really been a horror game fan, so when I started this game, I was still very worried about everything. I started off the game, started Leon's campaign first, standard difficulty. I had gotten about 2 hours in, still hadn't beaten the first boss, and had around eleven saves. Yeah, that was me haha. I then realized that I was being a bit too scared and that I should mellow out. I restarted the campaign. I was around one and a half hours in when I had encountered Tyrant. I was feeling good, however, I felt like I could do better. Restarted...one...more...time. I had gotten to the same point when I was an hour in. This game makes you feel so much fulfillment for really learning the game. I ended up finishing that run at 3 hours and 36 minutes, which made me a little angry as 6 minutes stood between an S rank and my A rank. By the end, I had three saves, and I also hadn't opened the item box once. I learned so much just by playing more and more, and I continually want to do further runs of the game. The gameplay is addictive, there is so much nuance to it. There are so many fine details it is honestly incredible. This game also managed to somehow make zombies scary again, which is a marvel because, for the past few years, traditional zombies have been quite stale. The zombies in this game feel like an actual threat, especially whenever there is more than one, they can easily gang up on you if you are not careful, and whenever you do get ganged up on, you don't feel as though it's the game's fault, anything that goes wrong always feels like the player's fault, the game doesn't feel unfair in the slightest. I'll admit there were moments where I was really scrounging for ammo and even, in some cases, healing items, but I didn't feel as though the game was being unfair, I more felt like it was my fault for being stupid and using up all my resources. There were also many times I got frustrated at the game, but then realized that it was all my fault because I hadn't discovered a weak spot on an enemy or something of the sort. The graphics are gorgeous too. I won't dive too much into my specs, however, the game ran 90fps-120fps consistently on my rig at 1440p at like high-very high settings. All of the technology that went into the game as well is impressive. The limb dismemberment is awesome and allows for the most realistic zombies in a game to date. I loved the story, and I thought that the characters were very likable, only further bolstered by the really great performances behind them. The performances of the main characters like Ada, Leon, and Claire were incredible and believable. The soundtrack of the game is marvelous too. When navigating through the tight corridors of the police station, the soundtrack is very eery and only adds to the overall atmosphere, really making the hairs on the back of your neck stand up. It can go from that to intense music during boss fights that really build up the scale and grandeur of the fight. The gameplay is really tight. The shooting feels satisfying and powerful, and when you learn a specific enemy's weakness, it really feels gratifying as, the enemy you once feared, can now be thwarted easily. The progression overall feels natural. I really enjoy the transition from fixed camera angles to a third-person, Resident Evil 4-6 style camera. One of the main things that kept me from getting into Resident Evil 2 Original or 3: Nemesis was the fixed camera angles and tank controls, I could just never get into them as they were very hard for me to use, but with this I can finally enjoy the story and characters while also enjoying the updated gameplay. The movement feels good, the characters have a good weight to them. I also love that, in this age of gaming, there is no transition between rooms like the older games, you just run through the door and are in the next room like that, which also allows enemies besides that of Tyrant or Nemesis to follow you into other rooms, further increasing the danger. Currently, I cannot think of a better example of a remake than Resident Evil 2. It is phenomenal and addicting in all the right ways.",Positive

The original Resident Evil games on PlayStation are one of my greatest childhood gaming memories, when the REmake came out on GC I had a PS2 so I only got to see other people play it or via videos on the Internet (this was before YouTube) I remember being desperate to play the game. Skip forward several years after I'd eventually played and loved the original, to more recently when the Resident Evil 2 remake was announced I was ecstatic, of course in this day and age with ALOT of sub-par AAA games I tried not to get my hopes up too high like I have done with several other games I'd been excited for (Deus Ex: Mankind Divided, Fallout 4, Far Cry 5, Dead Rising 4 etc) and been let down dramatically so, but Resident Evil holds a special place in my heart, and it does not disappoint. This is easily not only the best remake I've ever played, but the best game I've ever played. Not since I was a little kid have I gone to bed and not been able to sleep because I was thinking about a video game, Resident Evil 2 gives me that sensation and more, I love it, and you will too (If you're not easily scared)",Positive
710,resident-evil-2,Jripper93,"Feb  8, 2019",9,"Hardcore mode was amazing, the atmosphere was very claustrophobic and felt like I rarely had the amount of room needed to dodge enemies-a very good feel in a survival horror game.  I never had enough health and was one foot in the grave all the way up to the ending. The amount of ammo given felt a little off like there were too many bullets in the game, but maybe I was just playing a little too conservatively. The enemies were definitely a challenge. Other than the crazy amount of vram needed for this game in 2019 and really bad looking fire throughout the game this is a masterpiece that every survival horror enthusiast needs to enjoy.",Positive
711,resident-evil-2,shadow85,"Feb  8, 2019",9,"Excellent, and entertaining game! Thoroughly enjoyed it. This is definitely a perfect sort of remake. Everything about this remake was executed well, felt like a modern game yet retained its classic roots feel. Has to definitely be one of the best survival horror games so far. PRO's:Very good graphicsVery good gameplayGood classic story line CON's:Very short as RE games are ;(Hardcore mode could have been harder, was not too difficult for me. Doom on Nightmare was hard!I missed the upgrading the magnum parts like the previous original RE2 had. :(",Positive
712,resident-evil-2,error8,"Feb  7, 2019",9,"I liked the game, as long as I managed to play it. Pros:Good graphics and good optimization;Perfect sound. If you have a good 5.1 setup or Dolby Headphones it will make your hair stand up;It is quite an work of art in a way, the producer didn't cut any corners and brought to light one of the best horror survival games to date. Bad:The difficulty is horrible. The game play has absolutely no mercy for you. Everything you do has to be planed to the tinniest bit. Every mistake you make and get over, it will turn back to bite you, so hard that you will probably have to restart the game or reload a very old save. For instance if you don't use the wooden boards on the windows cleverly, you will have big difficulties in getting past the zombies further in the game. If you don't manage to save the ammo, you'll end up restarting the game. Even on assisted mode the game is still very difficult. Every move you make on the map, has to have at least two calculated possibilities until you make it. You'll have to save and reload a hundred times to pass a certain boss/situation. If you are the meticulous type and you enjoy a challenge, then this game is for you. Every other normal human should probably buy something else. For me it was a no go, because there was more stress then pleasure in this game while playing it.",Positive

Я давно хотел познакомиться с вашей серией, и это определенно - лучшее начало. Благодарю вас от всей души за качественный хоррор - крутые локации, крутая графика, безумный Мистер-Икс :)В этой игре качественно все, единственное - при прохождении сюжетных линий, в некоторых местах, они противоречат друг другу.

719,resident-evil-2,Kheetor,"Feb  4, 2019",8,"The remake of one of my favorite games had potential to blow my mind. Calming down after the hype it didn't quite do that. Of course I was going to love it, I'd love oatmeal if it was RE2-themed. The core gameplay is overall very good, it's streamlined and very easy to play. It skips a lot of stuff RE2 originally had but also adds some sections that fit it well. My favorite moments in the remake are the little ones, when you recognize a reference. Sherry lifting her leg while climbing up on a thing agonizingly slow. That limping female zombie next to the dumpster you climb on. There are some special events and areas (such as playing as another character) where completely new gameplay mechanics are forced on the player for a while. While they mostly feel out of place and tedious, they only compromise small parts of the game that overall is quite solid. I'm not sure what to make of the fact that there is enough ammunition to kill absolutely everything in the game on standard difficulty, provided you don't miss shots a lot. Roaming the empty hallways after you've cleared them does kill the survival horror vibe but I see no other way when you want to cater to completionists - and I'm glad they do. This game does play like an ego shooter if that's your style. It feels a lot like survival horror if you just rush forward without planning everything out. This game feels like it's aimed at modern shooter audience but if you're an old school RE fan you should give the demo try and see how it feels.",Positive

721,resident-evil-2,chusa19965656,"Feb  3, 2019",10,"Maravilloso lo que ha conseguido CAPCOM con este JUEGAZO. Resident Evil 2 ya era, de por sí, mi videojuego favorito de toda la franquicia y esto no hace más que afianzar eso. Las sensaciones que transmite este juego son demasiadas como para contarlas. Por momentos sentía mucha nostalgia por las similitudes que hay con el original, pero había momentos donde si lograba sorprenderme con alguna que otra cosilla además de esa tensión constante en la que te mantiene el juego para que no puedas pararte ni un solo momento a descansar. En ningún momento del juego pude sentirme tranquilo, siempre sentía que era observado o que en cualquier momento aparecería algo que me haría saltar de mi asiento. La atmósfera está muy bien lograda y el Soundtrack acompaña muy bien cada situación. Esto va más allá de un simple Remake, esto es un juego totalmente nuevo, es el Resident Evil 2 reimaginado en una forma totalmente distinta a la original, desde el apartado técnico/gráfico hasta la jugabilidad y la narrativa. Este Resident Evil 2 se inspira en su homónimo de 1998 pero sin querer ser un calco de éste. Recomiendo ampliamente a todo el mundo que le de una oportunidad este juego. Nunca creí que volver a Raccoon City sería tan aterradoramente divertido.",Positive

724,resident-evil-2,knallbob,"Feb  2, 2019",10,"Resident Evil 2 Remake Das Resident Evil 2 Remake ist das Remake des Klassikers von 1996. Im Vergleich zum Original hat sich an der Story nicht viel getan. Man spielt wieder als Leon Kennedy oder Claire Redfield. Dabei wurden die Zwischensequenzen in die Spielegrafik übertragen was diese nochmal deutlich aufwertet. Für Veteranen wurden einige neue Storyelemente und Zwischensequenzen eingeführt. Mehr soll hier auch nicht verraten werden, da das Spielgefühl sehr von der Unwissenheit des Spielers lebt. Im Gegensatz zur Story hat sich beim Gameplay einiges getan. So gibt es nun keine festen Kameraperspektiven mehr sondern eine Schulterperspektive welche dem Spieler in Actionsequenzen einen besseren Überblick gibt und für ein völlig neues Spielgefühl sorgt. Dennoch verkommt das Remake nicht zu einem reinen Actionspiel. Durch ständige Munitionsknappheit und einige (zum teils doch recht knifflige) Rätsel wird der Erkundungsdrang des Spielers gefördert. Durch gutes Sounddesign und atmosphärisches Lichtspiel kommt auch der Horror nicht zu kurz. Gespielt werden kann auch wieder im Veteranen Spielmodus mit nicht weniger Munition und stärkeren Gegnern. Die Spielzeit ist mit gut 7 Stunden pro Charakter auf dem leichtesten Schwierigkeitsgrad zwar nicht besonders lang, jedoch hat das Spiel durch seine verschiedenen Möglichkeiten die Story zu erleben einen hohen Widerspielwert. Insgesamt müsste man die Story viermal (zweimal mit jedem Charakter). Auch die Zusatzkampagne ""The 4th Survivor"" sorgt noch für weiteren Spielspaß. Schlußendlich kann man sagen das Capcom ein richtig gutes Remake und sogar ein richtig gutes eigenständiges Spiel gelungen ist. Eine absolute Kaufempfehlung geht an alle Horror und Resident Evil Fans",Positive
725,resident-evil-2,OverClusterARG,"Feb  1, 2019",9,"Resident Evil 2 no deja de ser un remake, pero tampoco un enorme trabajo de adaptación y, sobre todo, renovación. Mejor dicho, Capcom innova en cómo remasterizar un juego. El matiz resulta muy distinto al de la obra original, sin salirse ni un segundo de su intención primera. El compás del avance es excelente. El viaje desde un ambiente seguros a otro destila incertidumbre. La generación de empatía con los protagonistas se profundiza en diálogos y scripts. Los zombies surgen destrozados pero amenazantes. La propia comisaría expone algo único. La segunda entrega de la serie recibe una transformación que, casi 21 años después, la colocan nuevamente en el podio del gaming. Si fuesen películas, la de 1998 representaría formato clásico con planos definidos que van construyendo escenas. La actual sería el redescubrimiento de una forma de narrar continua: aunque menos purista, deviene más cercana al horror que solo un juego sabe contar.",Positive

727,resident-evil-2,ixenroh,"Jan 31, 2019",10,"To many it is a nostalgic feeling to be able to play this game yet again from a whole new perspective. To new players, this is a circus of virulent horror which will definitely claim them as fans of the series. The story has been polished and refined to perfection, the re-playability is through the roof and the challenge remains high. On the note of performance, the game boasts beautiful graphics, yet can run at very high FPS even on older machines, making it playable by a large amount of people without the need to upgrade their PC. The optimization is excellent, and the range of customization of the graphics options just proves the dedication of the developer them to make this game as excellent as it once was, and more!",Positive
728,resident-evil-2,Hack,"Jan 31, 2019",8,"I started with Leon on normal difficulty which I found a little too hard, so after completing it and I opted to start Claire on easy and enjoyed it much more, so if you're more interested in the story and gameplay and not a challenge I'd do the same. Personally I found Claire's campaign to be miles better than Leon's, hers had a better story, a better finale, better weaponry and a very interesting character who doesn't show up in Leon's playthrough. Overall her campaign definitely bumped up my rating of the game. As for the PC port, it's really good, it runs really well and has plenty of options so even moderate hardware should get a good frame rate. I played the game on GTX 1080 and was at 144fps most of the time at 1080p, so hitting the more common 60fps should be doable for a wide variety of cards.",Positive
729,resident-evil-2,Jridgen,"Jan 31, 2019",10,"To borrow from NVIDIA, a game that ""just works"".  I'm talking about the technical side.  It's refreshing to play a game that performs consistently and is almost completely free of bugs. Good start. From the 7 RE games I've played this is the second best in the series, only to RE4.  It's a near perfect blend of puzzle tasks and tense, claustrophobic action sequences.  Whereas RE6 jumped the shark into overpowered action frenzy, this game rarely lets up the tension because you constantly feel under threat.  Capcom did a great job of capturing the gameplay spirit of RE4. Although this game doesn't require you to stand completely still when performing a shot, it rewards you for doing so by focusing your cursor.  Of course, there's also the infamous scarcity of ammo. Did I mention the graphics are amazing at 4k? I'd take this engine cloned to any game out there. I was running it initially on a 980ti, but was due for an upgrade anyway, so pulled the trigger on a 2080. I can play it near maxed out, just lowering shadows and a couple other settings to get to 4k60.   Contrast this to another (relatively good) survival horror series, The Evil Within, which is a clunky mess technically (FPS drops, inadequate GPU/CPU usage), and has mediocre graphics. I tip my hat to Capcom.  I know most are calling for RE3 remake and don't think an RE4 remake is warranted since it already has the over the shoulder cam, but honestly, I'd be first in line for an RE4 remake with new puzzles, bigger areas, and dynamic lighting/fog effects. To me that game still edges this one out due to the variety of bosses, exotic locales, and (as subjective as it may be) a more engaging story.  To be a remade RE4 would be the game GOAT if done right. Still, it's refreshing to see another game come so close.",Positive

737,resident-evil-2,Daedalusfalls,"Jan 30, 2019",10,"While I can often be generous scoring a mediocre game, I rarely if ever call a game a 10. It takes a special experience to achieve that score. Resident Evil 2 for PS4 provides that experience. I played the original Resident Evil 2 when it first released during my college days, and I liked it a lot. I was excited for this remake, but I figured I would already know what was going to happen. Boy, was I wrong. Capcom has completely rewritten the events that happen in the game, and even if you have played the original dozens of times, you won't know whats coming in this new version. The quality of the gameplay is really mind blowing. The combat feels perfect, and the movement is smooth and silky. The graphics are outstanding, and do an excellent job conveying a sense of dread as you play. The sound is fantastic and adds so much to the creepiness. The music is extremely sparingly used, and what is there, is ambient and in the background. The only time it picks up is during certain scenes I won't describe for fear of spoiling something. If there is other music that I didn't notice, it's because it's so perfectly blended into the game. Speaking of spoiling, I highly recommend you go into this game blind if you can. The moments that shocked me would have had much less impact if I knew they were coming. If you are a fan of horror games, then this is a must buy. If you are a fan of games in general, I highly suggest you give it a shot. There are very few modern survival horror games of this type that receive the universal acclaim this game has received. If you have never played a survival horror game, this is a perfect entry into the genre. Capcom has provided 3 difficulty modes to fit every gamer. Hardcore for the survival horror experts, Standard, for those comfortable with shooters of this nature, and Assisted for those completely new to the genre, or for those who have difficulty aiming with a controller. If survival horror games intimidate you, there is no shame on giving it a go on an easier difficulty. It's such a great game, it would be a shame for someone to miss out on it. I can't recommend a game more highly than I recommend this one. Go out and play it!",Positive
738,resident-evil-2,Kuro88,"Jan 30, 2019",10,"Yes, yes, yes.. Resident Evil is finally back! And what a great game it is. As an old school RE fan, i really love how it turned out. Graphics are amazing, gameplay is also superb. The story is close to the original game, but has some more awesome background stories about some of the characters. I love it. There are some inconsistencies, for example about some of the technology that appears/ is used by characters in the game, but that can be overlooked. Also, the second run through (B scenarios) seem to be put in in a rush and don't match up the First runs as good as in the original game. I was a bit sad that Claire and Leon didn't meet up more often. But given the fact capcom actually told us there would be no second scenarios at all, i can live with that.",Positive

741,resident-evil-2,tremault,"Jan 29, 2019",7,"To preface, there is a lot of good about this game, but I need to tell you it's shortcomings. While the gameplay is excellent, and the game is something like 3 times longer than the original, there is a real lack of context. a lot of the files that we had in the original and text descriptions of things we could inspect, are all gone from this. This makes the world feel empty and less lived in. It's a real shame. the worst part though is how Capcom handled the two stories of the original. basically they're gone. this game is one story. except for some bizarre reason, you have to play the same game twice, once for Sherry's sections and again for Ada's sections and the proper ending.aside from those things, the game is pretty much exactly the same for both. Mr X was even pulled from mission B and put into all scenarios. This was a big disappointment. I was expecting to get a new B scenario with an enemy and events that did not happen in my first play-through. instead i got the A scenario of the other character and an extra boss at the end. This was so disappointing that I just feel the need to warn other potential players. I don't recommend this if you want 2 scenarios and The rich backstory we came to expect. only buy it if you want an exciting single story with great gameplay and environments and don't mind being forced to play it all again to get your full ending.",Average
742,resident-evil-2,Stalgren,"Jan 29, 2019",10,"An excellent remake and a very serviceable PC port. It makes enough changes to keep things fresh while still feeling very faithful to the original, and the shift to the more action oriented over the shoulder view doesn't make things any less tense or difficult as ammo management and avoiding unnecessary fights are still very much needed for survival. As cliche as it is to say, I honestly think this is a game that both old and new fans of Resident Evil can enjoy. If Capcom decides to remake Resident Evil 3 as well, if it's like this one then I would be more than optimistic for it's outcome.",Positive

Imagine this m8, you have a narrow corridor and zombie in front of you, 3 bullets in the gun and worn out combat knife. So what will you do , huh? Cry to mama, this is an option I guess but than you will become zombie's meal. Option A is to shoot off zombie's leg (should be doable with 3 bullets) and run quickly pass it.

There is so much subtle detail all over the environments. Shadows, lightning, reflections, everything is done excellently. I recommend playing on PC as the graphics truly shines there provided you have the proper hardware to run it. Gameplay: The level design and gameplay mechanics are an excellent mix between the old and new  seen in the original and new resident evil games. Suspense oozes out of every scene creating tension over every step. The shooting is extremely satisfying with hands down the best zombies and animations you can see anywhere in a game till date. The game is Single Player only with low replay value after the campaign is over, but it's one of the most gratifying experiences i've had in a long while.

762,resident-evil-2,JSXShadow,"Jan 27, 2019",10,"As Background: I have played all RE-Games in existence and have ran most of the originals (1-4) dozens of times each, knowing everything you can know about those games. Because of this, there can only be one verdict: This game is the best Resident Evil Game that has ever been made. The graphics are absolute state of the art, the gameplay a mix of old and new and exactly the way my younger self has dreamed of back in the day and most importantly: The Difficulty! This is a true Survival Horror game and I can only recommend ANYONE to play this game on Hardcore from the get-go (if you are experienced in the franchise or harder Survival Horror games). Ammo and healing are sparce and enemies are plenty, forcing you to actively run around some enemies and be very careful about not wasting all your stuff on needless encounters. You can put yourself into a position in which you basically have to restart the game (if you don't make several save-files) because you simply won't have enough Ammo to beat a boss. While some would say that this is too hard, it is a Survival Horror game. That is a big flaw with most games these days that claim to be horror: They are way too easy and allow you to mess around infinitely and still enable you to get through the game in a breeze. Personally, that is not Survival Horror for me. If you know you can't really fail..why would you ever be afraid? How could you ever tense up due to some encounters, when you know you will eventually make it through with little effort. This might sound unfair or gamebreaking for some but it was a needed change in the Survival Horror Formula that has been missing for way too long. As for the gameplay: Sure, it might not be very realistic to have to find key items to progress through doors that could be easily torn through with the weaponry available in the game. However, this is a remake from a classic game and it stays true to it's source and I can very much appreciate that. It's always weird when people complan about a lack in realism in games that include the undead and gigantic monsters, contained in high-tech underground facilities with technology that even now is far beyond our scope. You can acquire weapons in nearly every game that could destroy whole buildings..yet no one complains about them not doing exactly that. It is fiction, not everything has to make perfect sense but it utilizes those ""clunky"" mechanics well in it's favor. The atmosphere and constant dread is stunning, the utilization of Mister X (Tyrant) is even better than the original and truly  makes you feel terror because you can try to outrun it and die OR you shoot it down and waste valuable and needed Ammo for later on. Perfection. As for the Graphics..if you wanna see the maximum this game has to other you need to have very, very expensive hardware to get decent framerates in UHD and still decent Hardware to play it in FullHD with maxed out settings. However, if you can play it like that then you are in for a State-of-the-Art experience that is going to make your jaw drop. Textures are crisp, the visual effects and lighting is stunning, the characters all seem extremely realistic, down to the display of dirt and gore on the clothing of those characters. As for the Story: There is really not much to say if you knew the original. It basically stays true to it with a few alterations to utilize the capabilities of the modern time more effectively. I won't spoiler anything but it is made very well. Typical for a high-budget production. As for the controls: I have personally used a XBOX One Controller and have been very happy with it. Sure, there are some tank-ish controls and you do not have access to fancy dodging moves to prevent anything from even touching you but in this case that is a plus. Yet again this works in the favor of the Survival Horror Element of the game. If you could dodge anything then it probably would be too easy. Don't get me wrong, you can still dodge anything, just like back in the day, by smart movements and positioning and analyzing the enemies. It is hard to do and you will most likely get hit loads of times but that is ok. Mouse and Keyboard controls are solid, improving the aiming massively, as can be expected but you sacrifice a bit of comfort and immersion. As for the AI: I don't understand why so many reviews talk badly about the AI. It is far from bad and the zombies are by far the most threatening they have ever been. You cannot just bait them anymore and simply move past them like in the original games. They can even manage to grab you even if you manage to walk past them, adding another layer of difficulty. Some enemies cannot be simply dodged and you need to take calculated hits to get past some fights without wasting  too much Ammo. This game is not perfect but is perfect for what it tries to be. 100%.",Positive

764,resident-evil-2,PuckMan,"Jan 27, 2019",7,"First of all Capcom has done a great job on the PC version of this game in terms of optimization in the performance and customization in the options. You can really set the settings to your own liking (also very short loading times). Ok, the game is good, it's fun. Exploring the environments, puzzles, graphics, even the cutscenes and characters, all excellent. It mostly reminded me of RE7 with the inventory and simple but streamlined weapon upgrades and you can tell it's made with the same graphics engine. From the design of the game it is obvious you are not supposed to kill every enemy but instead run past many of them by either creeping, baiting an attack and then running or stunning with a bullet or grenade then running. The problem is when you can't do that enemies will grab you and this triggers a micro animation every time and it get's irritating when there's nothing you can do about it. If a licker shows up your supposed to be able to creep past it but realistically you have to kill it as there will also be other enemies near by that you have to run past and that will alert the licker. Boss fights are another weak element to the game. Runaway turn around shoot, runaway turn around shoot. And because your so slow and enemies are so fast you always get grabbed or hit which again becomes annoying. I think the longevity of this game will come down to speedrunning and possible future game modes like mercenaries. The question is do you want to speedrun this game when the enemies are such a pain.",Average
765,resident-evil-2,Rusty1984,"Jan 27, 2019",10,"After many attempts, finally Capcom got it right! A marvel which you can gaze at for hours. Accomplishments:+++ Graphics are to gawk at.+ Music/background music is maintaining its 90s essence while also something for current time.++ True surviving horror with just the right amount of helplessness and power.+++ Optimized for PC well, such as mid range PC's are able to enjoy at high settings(if done right).++ Giving the RE characters a life with realtime and real human like face movements and expressions along with their whinny and encouraging self talks, it makes you always feel present along with them.+ Right amount of durations of scenarios for each character.( If speed ran, then short and bloody) Possible neglects:-- To ask €60 for a basic game for a remake? A tad bit pricey, €40 for current game IMO. For the current price however; Could have provided with an alternate scenarios for each character in addition, albeit not very long but something which does not have remake logo on it. Humble suggestions*** Free to a very low price DLC which adds new scenarios to each main character.* Allow some very limited item(s) to carry over to new game plus. All put together it's a force to racoon with.

780,resident-evil-2,IlyaLakmus,"Jan 25, 2019",10,"Я начал ждать Resident Evil 2 ещё лет 5 назад. А когда Capcom анонсировали её, я очень сильно обрадовался. Прошло пару лет, и было чувство, что Capcom забили на ремейк. Ровно год назад, на 20-тилетие Resident Evil 2 1998-ого года, я думал и верил, что ремейк неожиданно или выпустят, или скажут что он доделывается. Ничего из этого не произошло. Началось лето, и вместе с ним E3 2018. На нем окончательно и официально анонсировали ремейк. Я был просто счастлив. Но в придачу к этому, ремейк объявили лучше игрой выставки E3 2018. Я чувствовал такую гордость за Capcom, что не могу передать словами. А трейлеры игры я пересматривал за день десятками раз. Перейдем к самой игре. Capcom идеально совместили стиль Resident Evil 4 и саму Resident Evil 2. Игра и страшная, и бодрая, и интересная, и с загадками, в общем, как мы любим. Игре вроде 21 год, но такое чувство, что это совсем другая игра. В чём-то это так и есть. Некоторые места ты сразу узнаешь, что в той или другой комнате поменяли. Но есть и совершенно новые комнаты. Сюжет идет совсем другой дорогой (в буквальном смысле). Если тут, играя за Клэр, ты на лифте Шефа Айронса возвращаешься в R.P.D., то в оригинале наоборот, ты выбираешься с его помощью. Не буду сильно спойлерить и портить ощущения от игры. Игру обязательно покупайте. Capcom в последнее время начала просыпаться и делать превосходные игры, как в былые времена.Оценка: 10/10",Positive

785,resident-evil-2,FanaticGamer89,"Jan 25, 2019",10,"Resident Evil is back for real. So many elements is nailed just right. Let me try and make it short and sweet. Pros:+ Graphics - Game look simply stunning, and it's wonderfully optimized, plays well on many configurations + Sound - from the eerie sound of your own footsteps to the creepy noises of the undead to the gunshots ringing out in the hallways, the sound design is simply perfection. + Atmosphere and nostalgia - They really nailed the feeling from the original Resident Evil 2 while still keeping it fresh and up to modern standards, as a Resident Evil fan that have played every single one of them, I am highly satisfied. And no I'm not just a completely fanboy that can't see wrong, recently Resident Evil 6 did a lot of things terribly and is possibly my least favorite game in the series. +Gameplay - Compared to a lot of games that eventually lets you have the feeling of safety, Resident Evil 2 remake never gives you this. You don't have enough ammo to kill all enemies, if you don't board up the windows they'll keep coming at you. You'll have to bob and weave, shoot for the legs, run as fast as you can to avoid the enemies. And without spoiling too much you'll surely know what it means to be powerless, to just have to run for your life. ~Story - I consider this element neutral, the story is what it is, it's resident evil so it's kind of corny, it's just what the franchise is known for. If you've enjoyed previous entries I see no reason why you wouldn't enjoy this. If you're the kind of person looking for oscar nominee performances you're not going to find it here. -Cons - It was really difficult to come up with something, yes the game can be brutally difficult and frustrating at times, but I don't really feel like this is a con as much as a ""git gud"" type of situation. Through and through Capcom have made a home run with Remake 2 and I desperately hope to see them recreate other games in the franchise with the same attention to detail and passion to please it's core audience. Can't recommend this game highly enough, in fact, if you by any chance is still reading, I beg you to buy the game, give Capcom a reason to keep producing these amazing games.",Positive

The content of many notes is like a cheap action movie. A lot of boxes and save-machines, every moment. Zombie with a parasite on his head, pulled out of re 4, which does not make sense, because it was a separate virus (plague), in practice they are only annoying and have a large range. They pressed it for more action. Ridiculous actions, for example, Jill gets a rocket in his legs, flies away, gets up and runs away. Embarrassing Carlos speech and little feminine Jill. Motion blur cannot be turned off. A lot of ugly textures, strong aliasing, weak reflections. Nice character models.  Re 7 had better graphics. You can't save yourself with a knife or grenade from the attack, which was important for survival in re 2. Zombie bodies do not have such good damage effects, their limbs disappear, sometimes even whole bodies (as in re6). Killed zombie bodies are like a rock, they become part of stationary textures. Evident downgrade. Zombies are often assigned to a place, they can't break the door often, they don't follow you, they just turn back, you get in, shoot and leave, ridiculous, they can also disappear after the cut scene. Opponents stronger than zombies can't open the door, Carlos opens the door, runs away and comes back again to shoot once etc. Few classic fights with nemesis, his second form is a running furious dog-like mutant. Escapes from the nemesis are short and includes only a few locations. Lots of ammo and lots of empty locations without zombies. The sewers lcoation is a joke, opponents in them are easier than zombies. Boring filler between meetings with nemezis. The last fight with a nemesis at a nightmare level is the ordinary QTE without signaling and poorly done. Nemesis is only faster and can kill you even quickly after you dodge. Terribly wasted potential and fearless survival action horror...The last fight at higher difficulty levels is just a QTE spam without signaling. You didn't like QTE in re 5 and 6? Well now you have the most ludicrous QTE spam sequences without signals and at the very end of the game, what a surprise, one only big difficulty spike. A small town, only to run, especially before the nemesis. Evidently, some locations and explorations are missing between the fights with the nemesis, the game is stacked like canned food. The game pretends to be an action-resident evil, but it is even far from being like RE 6. Idiotic story changes and cut locations in relation to original Re 3 nemesis.There is nothing to excite, only capcom simps are full happy and offended by justifiable criticism. They make reimaginations because it is convenient and simpler for them (they can change the elements of the original freely and have an excuse) plus the old title will always earn money on nostalgia for them, simple and pragmatic, for corporations, but not so good for consumers.",Negative

824,resident-evil-3,metju,"Feb  9, 2023",8,"Resident Evil 3 Remake is a thrilling reimagining of a classic survival horror game. The game takes place in the same universe as Resident Evil 2, and follows Jill Valentine as she tries to escape Raccoon City while being pursued by the monstrous Nemesis. The graphics are stunning, with the attention to detail being especially noticeable in the environments and character designs. The sound design is equally impressive, with creepy sound effects and a haunting soundtrack that will keep you on edge throughout the game. The gameplay is fast-paced and action-packed, with an emphasis on resource management and quick thinking. The addition of the dodge mechanic adds an extra layer of strategy, as you'll need to be constantly on the move to avoid Nemesis' attacks. The story is well written, with excellent voice acting that brings the characters to life. The game is shorter than Resident Evil 2 Remake, but it's still packed with tension, suspense, and horror. In conclusion, Resident Evil 3 Remake is a fantastic addition to the Resident Evil franchise. It offers a fresh take on the original game while still staying true to its roots. If you're a fan of survival horror or just looking for a thrilling and well-made action game, this Remake is definitely worth checking out.",Positive

830,resident-evil-3,imoviesreview,"Jan 10, 2023",8,"I really enjoy this game. But yeah like many people said, this doesn't quite match Resident Evil 2 Remake. I'm also aware that areas from the original game are not here. This plays nearly identically to RE2 Remake. But this game does try to throw a new spin on it. RE2 tension was more around the long term planning. ""Which zombie should I kill? when am I going to run into MR X? or what if my plan goes horribly wrong?"" In this game, tension comes from how nonstop the danger is. Although at first the game wasn't quite clicking with me. It's when Nemesis is introduced in the city when it all comes together. I know many are disappointed that he is scripted unlike MR X. But I feel that kind of helps with the nonstop tension. And because of that, it also allows Nemesis to do thing MR X could not do in RE2. The only issue I found with that fact that this uses RE2 Remake assets is that it does lead some mechanic clashing. Stealth isn't a thing in the game unlike RE2. Expect for when Lickers show up which are clearly ripped from RE2. Which there are only 2 in the whole game. But the ultimate problem is that even if we ignore how this is a remake. It doesn't offer as much as RE2. This game only has one character with one scenario. Unlike RE2 2 Character with 2 scenario each. This game scenario is maybe slightly longer then a RE2 scenario. But this is a 6 hour campaign. Also RE2 Remake is just better in general. So I would recommend RE2 Remake first. But if you really enjoyed RE2 Remake and you want more, then I can recommend this game!",Positive

While I appreciate it, I do think they went kind of heavy on the action. I think this is more of a reimagining of the original game, rather than a remake. The graphics are fantastic, the sound design is excellent, the controls are pretty good, it’s a decently wrapped package. The gameplay was fun and intense at times, but it wasn’t the most memorable. This game just feels like an experience that comes and goes - you’ll enjoy it enough to beat it, but then you’ll never think back on it again.

The writing, characters and story are all top tier, along side with the monster design and intense combat (especially on the higher difficulties). I found myself really enjoying exploring and trying my darndest to survive the somewhat ""complex"" level design as it loops in on itself while you look for items to move on from point to point. Although, with that said, I couldn't help but finding myself rolling my eyes at nemesis all while becoming very frustrated with how much more I had hoped some of the combat actions were more fine tuned and precise. It was also more cheesy at parts than I had hoped. I know that the resident evil series is often cheesy and that can be some of the charm to it. I just don't want it to be, I know I'm in the minority with that thought, but I actually have always disliked that aspect. Anyways, it's definitely worth getting on sale.

It is ridiculously easy to fight all the enemies and good weapons and health items are basically force fed to you to the point that you might fill ur whole inventorywith health items just by going through one level. While some people may be disappointed that Capcom did not stay true to the OG, i feel that this game for what has been presented is fine. Although Nemesis is a big part of the game, his actions dont seem as persistent as Mr X in RE2. Maybe its cos Nemesis is more violent, but for me this is not an issue.The dodge button, however, is something very tricky to master. When low in hp and ammo, you will want to dodge the zombie, but i can say that this dodge works only 40% of the time.

Like Nemesis, completely upstaged by Mr. X, Nemesis's only section where he actually chases seems bugged and just isn't effective.

858,resident-evil-3,DudeLove,"Aug  9, 2022",2,"To start, I'm a long-time Resident Evil fan. Started playing when the first came out back in 1996. I've played all the mainline series, the remakes, and many of the off-shoot titles. I'm not new to the RE scene. The original Resident Evil 3 was probably one of the best in the series. The Nemesis, branching paths, and the ability to dodge were all a pretty big jump from the previous game. But I just could NOT get into this game. The graphics are good, even though today we still get blurred writing on most environmental objects. The Nemesis shows up way too early; the pacing from the original where the Nemesis shows a bit into the game made for a much better flow. There were too many changes to the characters. I still like Jill Valentine's previous face model a bit more. Brad's character is completely different; you see him in 2 scenes (alive) in the original, but this one you only get one, and he's a more noble and selfless than in the original. It just doesn't jive with his character. Dodging doesn't seem to work all that great, but maybe I didn't play it enough. I do know that several areas were cut, as well as few puzzles. It just feels shallow and hallow. It feels like this could've been something way better, but the developers settled for ""good enough"". If you never played the original, you might like this. It's not a terrible game. But as someone that played the original, I have to compare it. And if you put both games in front of me, I would choose the original.",Negative

Most of the game is copied from RE2, but I guess that's okay as long as it keeps you entertained.I felt like the game is less spooky than RE2, and another thing is there were no puzzles in the game. At least they could make player to search every inch of the map to find a specific item.It takes 4 hours to finish the game, which is way too short comparing to RE2 or any other AAA game.In conclusion, I don't understand this rush to publish the game, as it could be a masterpiece if they made the game a little longer and with more complicated puzzles to solve and places to explore.

Re3 was one of my favorites back in the day, and this is an extraordinary way to re-experience the classic. Re2 remake was great too, but Mr X suffocated the experience for me, making for some repetitive and frustrating encounters. The way they reduced these encounters with nemesis on Re3 is fantastic, even thou most of them are scripted, everyone one of them is memorable and well-executed. Mr X was more dynamic in theory, but in the practice sometimes can break the gameplay experience and become boring. I think the graphics are great, could not use the latest update to enable Ray Tracing, even in 1080p the game has frequent frame rate drops with my Asus ROG RTX 2060 & Intel I9. Seems like you need more power to run the game at a stable 60 FPS with RT at 1080p. Without RT the game runs really smooth with everything maxed. Loved the way Carlos and Jill character arcs are mixed together. The cat and mouse dynamic with Nemesis are great, as encounters are not that frequent, and the game keeps you guessing when he is going to get the drop on you again. Railgun Jill was so badass, I think she is my favorite female character. I was going to give the game a 9 because Jill is like a terminator, she takes so much damage during the game, and she keeps going, but when nemesis showers Jill with missiles, and she gets up that was kinda too much.

879,resident-evil-3,Baltifru,"Feb 13, 2022",8,"Dear Resident Evil 3, you get a blue thumb because I love your universe, I like the atmosphere on these early episodes of the franchise... But frankly you were that close to getting a red thumb. Let's get things straight: although you'll most certainly have a good time with this remake, Resident Evil 3 is quite similar to Resident Evil 2, but worse in every possible aspect. Players can clearly feel that this game was rushed to benefit quickly from the success that Resident Evil 2 had: reuse of countless assets, scenes from the original game removed, very short campaign and no mercenaries mode... damn, what a waste. I can't really forgive Capcom for doing this, they could have taken their time to develop a complete game that would have been a real tribute to the original. Instead, the only feeling I had when I finished the game was that I was missing something, that my experience is not complete until I play the original game. Concretely, the first big problem with Resident Evil 3 Remake is the level design. RE games are known to have a brilliant design in their early stages (mansion, RPD, train, Baker's house...) and get annoyingly more and more linear until the end. With this RE3R, you can skip altogether the first part: after a first hour (at most) where you can still have the illusion of an interesting layout of keys and locked areas, you'll realise that even Raccoon City is not very difficult to figure out and to navigate in a linear fashion. Beyond this point and unlike in RE2R for example where 2/3 of the game are just one, huge map with excellent design, RE3R is split into several segments of a few minutes to one hour each. This effectively linearises the game even more, on top of preventing the player from trying to reach areas/items they couldn't reach immediately.The gameplay is exactly the same as in RE2R, except for a few downgrades: no blue herb anymore, no possibility of countering zombie attacks with knives or grenades, and fewer (and much more basic !) puzzles... This is in my opinion one big failure here, there is not a single puzzle worth mentioning in this game, and even less so a challenging one. Puzzles are a trademark of the Resident Evil series so I don't really understand what happened there. Finally, if you've already played RE2R, you won't feel much of this tension when playing RE3R. Seeing the layout of the different maps, you can almost predict when a jumpscare is gonna happen and, well, that obviously defeats the purpose of the jumpscares. The staging reuses everything that RE2R had, except that this time, there is no surprise anymore. But hey, Nemesis saves the party, right ? I am sure that, just like me, many of you dreamt of this RE3R with great cat-and-mouse sequences with the horrific Nemesis, using the same AI (or better) than that of Mr. X in RE2R, in a great level design that makes the hunt even more thrilling, like the RPD did. Well, forget about all of this ! Capcom apparently didn't have enough money to hire Nemesis for the job, so they hired NemeScript, his twin brother suffering a very rare disease that prevents him to move until he hears the typical sound of a clapperboard. Seriously though, the first 20 minutes of the game are gimmicky cutscenes mixed with QTE where you'll see Nemesis from every possible angle, but for which no AI programming was necessary. Beyond this point, even in the Hardcore mode (the hardest mode available for the first playthrough), you have to really screw up to give Nemesis time to actually chase you down in more than just the main street of Raccoon City. If you play even just a bit cleverly, you'll notice Capcom always leaves a grenade at the right spot so that you can just throw it at him and leave him call for his mama for one minute, time during which you will continue shopping around without caring about his poor souls. And once you're done with this map, Nemesis will never be anything else but a protagonist of other cutscenes, other QTE and some boss fights. This is a huge letdown for all of those like me who were looking forward to epic Mr.X-like moments with Nemesis. If you are looking for this, RE3R is definitely NOT the game for you. RE3R is still blue-thumb worthy in my opinion because I love this franchise, and probably if RE2R hadn't existed, my view on this game would be a bit different. I still loved the atmosphere of this game, the graphics and especially some very well-made facial animations. But for all the reasons above, I'll have a hard time forgiving Capcom for rushing the development so much, considering that the original game and some of the RE2R elements were great material to do so much better.",Positive

They have cut down the puzzles (there are hardly any), the world is built in pretty linear pathways and there are many cut-scenes, so the plot is forced in a certain direction. While in RE2 you had a genuine feeling of being free to explore a giant mansion, which appeared truly scary and also more realistic, in RE3 your are mostly forced into certain paths. But not only that, even the enemies aren't that well made in the RE3 remake, they are not as detailed in their behaviour and thus they seem less frightening. While Mr. X appeared truly frightening to me, the Nemesis is not even scary anymore because he appears all the time and you can easily dodge him with the new dodge-move. In sum, they wasted the potential of a great game. If you love RE, you should nevertheless give this game a try, but if you already played RE2, you will be disappointed in the lack of quality they have put into this game.",Negative

896,resident-evil-3,kingofkoopas,"Sep 26, 2021",3,"'Resident Evil 3' is boring, scripted, nearly brain dead, and of course unfinished. First things first, the new Jill is too average looking and looks like a child. The nasty butch hairstyle makes her look worse. This new Jill is as some have already mentioned it is a re-skin of the new Lara Croft. Her endless profanity towards Nemesis really breaks immersion. How am I supposed to be scared of the hulking beast if Jill clearly isn't? She and Carlos are always referring to him as ""that fu**er"" and other combinations. What ""realism"" we get by having our heroes speaking like uneducated thugs! If they ever remake this remake again, it would not be surprising if Nemesis himself calls Jill a ""bit**"". Nemesis chases you a few times and most of the encounters are scripted. He is the only boss in the game and you get to fight him three times with two of those fights being very similar. For a character that is supposed to be an unstoppable stalker/predator; It's fairly easy to keep your distance from him. Because in this game, he is just pretending to chase you, it's all scripted easy bullcrap. The more ""real"" games become the more idiotic and soul-less they are getting. People think immersion is having a scripted movie/game with characters who are flawed and speak like criminals. Experience this modern Jill and then go back and compare her to the class act she is in REHD and RE5. She was beautiful, strong, and didn't need to act tough. She also never once cursed or used profane language, yet the gamers have their rated M rating. Now that I got the characters out of the way. It's time to talk about the gameplay and here is where the game suffers more. The game is mostly point and shoot, hardly any tactics are required. The Hunters are the only enemy in the game that pose a threat, especially if you manage to aggro more than one of them. There is a part of the game that is really puzzling as to why it's even part of it. The section of the game where you have to power 4 switches in a maze and you are being attacked by what seems like endless spiders. They introduce a strange mechanic in the game at that point that you would think will carry on, but no, it is never seen again after that. On a totally hentai tentacle scene, Jill gets abused by a parasite creature and suddenly you have contracted parasites. They slowly drain your health away and make your HUD a pain to look at. There are of course no blue herbs, so how do you get rid of the parasites? Green herb of course.... And that's that, after you complete that tedious mini maze and it really is tedious, that mechanic is gone from the game. There are way too many save stations, auto-saves and ammo too. Some people complained that in RE7 there was not enough ammo. I felt like RE7 had too much of it, but here I just don't think anyone should have an ammo problem. I got this game on a sale for $17 and I feel like I was $3 away from being ripped off. The game has almost zero replay value. There is no mercenaries mode, no new game+ or unlockable modes. I don't really see why anyone would bother with a second play through. I played this after Resident Evil Village waiting for it to go on a sale. I can say I am finally done with this franchise. I don't think I will participate in the RE4 remake. Resident Evil 3 still manages to be a better game than the abomination that is Resident Evil Village.",Negative

898,resident-evil-3,Munizord,"Sep 23, 2021",6,"Como o produtor já disse que Resident Evil 3 é ""um produto finalizado"", tirando qualquer esperança de DLC de história, não tem como recomendar essa compra. Suas vendas ocorreram em meio a pandemia, o que me leva a pensar que não houve um acabamento bem feito. No remake do Resident Evil 2, a Capcom acertou em cheio em uma jogabilidade fluida e fiel ao original. O jogo dá sensação de medo e incerteza do que vai vir, história levemente alterada, com algumas incompatibilidades mas muito boa ainda. O Resident Evil 3 foi uma tentativa de ir além, de aumentar a ação, e assim como Resident Evil 6, ficou ruim e desnecessário. A história foi completamente alterada e ficou muito pior do que o original. O jogo é curto, o que não é um problema, mas ele é extremamente linear. O jogo acelera tanto a história e é cansativo, porque você está na maioria do tempo correndo pra frente. Todos os cenários são breves, não dá pra sentir o ambiente, é como se tudo fosse um corredor, um cenário de mudança para a próxima cutscene. Enquanto o 2 refez seus cenários com novos gráficos e designs, este aqui criou coisas novas. São muito bonitas mas são tão passageiras que não dá tempo de observar. O jogo mudou sua história para reutilizar muitos recursos criados no 2 e fica uma cópia tão ruim que fica chato de jogar. Conseguiram transformar o Nemesis, que era a mais perigosa arma biológica já criada da série, em um experimento falho que não cumpriu nenhum de seus objetivos, além de ter uma mutação genética bizarra e comportamento pior ainda. Os personagens estão incríveis, tanto a modelagem quanto na personalidade e dublagem, a Jill e o Carlos são os maiores pontos positivos deste jogo. Os gráficos e efeitos sonoros também são excelentes, embora tenha presenciado alguns problemas de renderização e travamento em várias ocasiões.O jogo é raso, completamente raso, age como uma DLC para o 2. Me senti jogando o Separate Ways do Resident Evil 4, pois é basicamente uma versão inferior ao Resident Evil 2.Falha como Remake, falha como jogo individual (pelo menos neste preço e com este nome) e falha com um enredo ruim. Para quem já jogou o original, este jogo é um insulto. Todo momento você estará se perguntando ""Mas já?"", até chegar na parte final que você estará afirmando ""Finalmente"". Este jogo tem partes muito boas, mas elas são tão poucas que chega a ser frustrante tamanho desperdício de potencial. As dificuldades são pessimamente balanceadas, o esquema de esquiva tem um design falho, nenhum jogo de esquiva te permite esquivar infinitas vezes em sequência, o que deixa esse jogo mais fácil do que ele já é, independente da dificuldade. Não digo que é algo ruim, mas é como se o jogo fosse balanceado pelas dificuldades em ""não sabe esquivar"" e ""sabe esquivar"". Dificuldade adaptativa quase inexistente. Tem jogos que mudam progressivamente de cenários mais fáceis para mais difíceis. A sensação do RE3 é que você começa em cenários fáceis e progride para cenários ainda mais fáceis.É interessante comparar o início desse jogo com o início de The Last of Us, por exemplo. É estranho, mas no The Last of Us (2013) você demora bastante tempo até o jogo começar de fato. Pelo menos os primeiros 30-40 minutos de jogo são tutoriais, e o jogo é completamente linear, mas a imersão e a velocidade são adequadas. No caso do RE3, os primeiros 20 minutos são muito similares na questão de gameplay, só que não tem nada relevante acontecendo, nada impactante, são só uma sequência de clichês até o real gameplay. Você se sente em uma esteira completamente inútil e de nenhum valor a agregar na história nem na personagem. Não é algo memorável (bom, na verdade é, é bem memorável como que a introdução ficou mal feita).Isso sem contar a imensa redução no ""gore"", comparado com o RE2. O curioso é que, mesmo com essa redução de violência gráfica, a Jill é frequentemente hipersexualizada durante o jogo: em ângulos de câmera, ataques de criaturas específicas e lutas contra o Nemesis. Ah, produções japonesas...Se quiser jogar pela história, melhor comprar o original de 1999, a venda na PSN do PS3. Se quiser ver como que aquele jogo de 1999 está nos gráficos atuais, jogue a demo gratuita. Não compre e jogue imaginando como o jogo seria bom, porque a realidade é bem diferente.Único estímulo para rejogar são as conquistas dentro e fora do jogo. Enquanto Resident Evil 2 foi o jogo do ano de muitos ano passado, este aqui é a Decepção do Ano de muitos.Jogo vazio, apressado, frustrante e decepcionante.",Average

902,resident-evil-3,Babutto,"Jul 14, 2021",6,"I have been playing ALL RE evil games for the last several months. And this game is a disappointment. Why? Pros.:- New graphics.- Flexible and comfortable controls.- Old loved characters, their mimics, animation.- System of bonuses, go there, remember this, remember that. Go back here with a lockpick and find the pouch.- References to other games, like RE7 (toys). Cons. (many):- Redesign of Jill. I don't understand - WHY is her previous design and face was bad? I could understand the redesign of Clair, Leon, and Ada, but they were close to the original. At least make a modern model with the older Jill design as a DLC or free unlockable DLC.- The levels seem to cut. You literally play the game and feel it was cut here and there. I have never played the original RE3, so I'm not obscured by the predecessor. But I remember the complexity of RE4, the complexity of RE7, the action-like simplicity of RE5 and RE6. This game has a bit of RE2 (that is amazing in its complexity and balance between puzzles and action) but mostly resembles RE5 and RE6. The cut scenes and their uselessness resemble me another RE failure - RE Revelations 2.- Battles with Nemesis are garbage. He's either a supervillain killing you in two blows or he is a dumbass waiting for you until you run away. When he transformed into a bigger spider-lurker-like monster it was a facepalm. I remember in RE2R you may hear the Tyrant walking and feel terrified, running away and wasting the last of your grenade launcher rounds. Here - nope. No suspense. Just scripted scenes.- The same trick over and over again - the enemy lying behind and silently standing up. You go back from the enemies in front of you, shoot, and then the one behind bites you. Stupid way of making the game more difficult.- Wasted locations with multiple spaces - police station, hospital. Level design is poor. The game had potential but it was wasted.- The game should have repeated the way RE2R did - playing Carlos or Jill, seeing the events from different perspectives. But the game fails to be a suspense, it fails to be a battle with a supervillain, it fails to be a dual narrative. So, I don't recommend to buy it until it's VERY cheap alongside with its DLCs.",Average

La jugabilidad en general está bastante bien llevada, aunque el diseño de mapas y entornos es mucho más lineal, invitando menos a la exploración y más al avance; esto combina con la práctica desaparición de los puzzles para hacer un juego más centrado en la acción y en avanzar rápido. Lo cual es un problema, habida cuenta que es un juego más bien tirando a corto y con muy pocas razones para seguir jugando una vez terminado (sin modo Mercenarios ni nada por el estilo). La historia está más o menos decente, aunque tampoco es una maravilla, pero si tiene algunos momentos interesantes e importantes en la trama general de RE. Gráficamente el juego está muy bien, con unas ambientaciones muy bien creadas y un excelente modelado de personajes y situaciones, y muy buenas animaciones también. El sonido cumple bastante bien, aunque la música quizás tiene poca presencia e importancia. Y, al menos en mi caso, no me he encontrado con ningún bug. El resultado de todo ello es un juego entretenido y que permite disfrutar sus horitas, contando una historia decente en el universo de RE.

A few sections where you are focused on clearing zombies would have added to the length and satisfaction overall. As the gunplay in RE3 R is perfect, your  not OP and always on the back foot making the wins feel very relieving. Its just as Survival horror combst should be.

924,resident-evil-3,MrPajamas,"Apr 29, 2021",7,"Resident Evil 2 Remake from 2019 pleased me very much with its quality of workmanship.  Although it seems that in the beginning it is the case with the third part, it is not quite so.  I'm Resident Evil 3 again, as the other one didn't.  Intended for the original game.  But I went through the second thanks to the remake, so I was looking forward to the triple and although I got a perfect game, it's not exactly what I would expect from Resident Evil.  Right from the start, the game will show you your main female character Jill, for whom you will play.  It doesn't take long for a Nemesis to break into your room, which can make a gap that is several times larger than Mr.  X from the last part.  So you're asking what's wrong?  Tyrant stronger and that should be better, right?  Yes, it could have been, but the problem is a bit that the game has a predefined scenario, in other words, how players know the so-called scripted passage.  It's no longer like in a couple, where Mr.  X was walking around the police station and you didn't know when he would show up.  No.  Here you just get a cut-scene, and when Nemesis is needed for the story, he shows up, almost kills you, but then he climbs somewhere again and the ground seems to fall on him.  So while playing, you don't feel like someone is still after you, which is a shame, because this worked perfectly in the second part.  On the one hand, even if Nemesis isn't going after you, someone will still go after you, and especially at the end of the game, you will shoot head to head.  Towards the end of the game and it will happen in a few hours.  Another Resident Evil game.  Yes, a short game time can be expected, but the remake also removed some parts of the original game, which I saw on YouTube.  I personally don't know, because as I mentioned, I didn't play the original part.  But what I noticed while playing was the fact that there was perhaps only one puzzle for the whole game, which I solved quite quickly, so I could continue playing.  So the pace is deadly.  For another game, it could be taken as a plus, but here at RE, you think you're right that the game should be slower and build the atmosphere of fear along with the feeling that you have few charges.  You know, though.  No.  Here you will think of Nemesis right at the beginning, and then I said goodbye.  A quick and action-packed introduction that draws us into the action and the game slows down now.  But no.  The game keeps going and almost never stops.  Especially when it comes to the part where you play for Carlos, who has a proper arsenal (meaning RE, where you have a gun with barely a few rounds) and you will shoot all those scumbags quickly and action.  Real gaming enjoyment.  Oh yes.  But it doesn't sit well with Resident Evil.  Not to criticize, I praise the graphics.  In the second part, it already looked beautiful compared to the original game, and this also applies here.  Again huge progress and the game looks much better and overall don't take me wrong.  That game is good.  I liked her.  It's just that this is not the Resident Evil that I would expect and especially for the price you get ... I finished the game in 4 hours and I remind you that it is a 60 € game.  So how do you say it.  Overall, this is a good game.  A good action game that I will recommend, but only if you are counting on action and not a slower approach in Resident Evil style and especially I recommend you to wait for discounts, because I dare say this game does not deserve, because in a few hours you are done.",Average

929,resident-evil-3,dandalis,"Mar  6, 2021",6,"Without prior experience with the original Resident Evil 3 release, i had no reference point for the remake, however i kept on hearing about how the remake excludes significant portions of the original game, such as entire levels, how the remake takes questionable creative decisions when it comes to gameplay, such as encounters with Nemesis, and the revisioned characters aswell.For a 60 $ single player focused game, the length is quite laughable, even as someone who tends take my sweet time with every game i play, i beat RE3 remake in around 6 hours, so knowing that major corners were cut, disappointment of others was quite understandable now. The core gameplay is pretty much identical to RE2 remake, though RE3 remake sees the addition of a evade mechanic, which freezes you for a good moment in place after evading enemies, which is irritating. Even then, it felt like the evade option barely worked, as zombies can grab you so easily, even when you feel like you're a good distance from them. Enemy AI can become kind of a joke, something that happaned with the hunter type in the hospital level, where they couldnt get through doors and tried to attack me by glitching through them.Gunplay felt mostly fine, except for the Carlos assault rifle, it felt too nerfed. Guns sadly lacked impactful sound effects, the pistol sounded rather generic and AR sounded like borderline airsoft. There's also something weird going on with how you aim the shotgun, when you aim it vertically, Jill keeps it horizontally, making for a jarring sight. The story feels rushed, but even then it offers some interesting twists and turns. The disturbing feeling of Nemesis being on your heels is there, but all too many encounters with him are either very scripted or just cutscenes where you cant make it out whether the game plays itself or is about to hand the controls over to you. I guess atleast it beats the obnoxious quick time events of older RE games. While i dont know how Jill was portrayed in the original game, i've read that she was no where near as edgy as she is in the remake. She swears too much, which just doesnt feel in character compared to depictions of her that i've seen in other RE games. The way Capcom here is trying to make her more in line with modern, western, action oriented female characters isnt realistic or ''relatable'', it's just sub-par writing, something that gaming industry as a whole needs to drop. Swearing doesnt make a female character tough, it just reincarnates a worse version of the ''dude-bro'' stereotype, but with the opposite gender. The reimagining of Jill's classic outfit was disappointing too. Instead of updating and adding her optional classic outfit version from RE1 remake, Capcom gets the materials wrong and instead of a skirt, she now wears a stupid skort, so...well done botching another aspect of her character appeal. ""But it's more realistic and practical'' you'll say...then how can she lift a rail gun, which is meant to be mounted on armored combat vehicles, that probably weighs several times Jill's own weight ? Realism my arse. I dont know about others, but i experienced some very odd performance issues with RE3 remake. Whenever i boot up the game, it heavily laggs for about two minutes, be it in the start menu or in game, then it goes away. Another issue is micro stuttering during gameplay which persists through out all the game and never goes away, regardless of the graphical settings, it doesnt render the game unplayable, but it does make it annoying. My PC meets  the game's system requirements, and most importantly, these issues dont occur when i play the RE2 remake, which shares the same technology with RE3 remake. So what the hell ? Yet i still want to say that i had a reasonably decent time with the game, it has flaws, though it can still be enjoyed, but Capcom should've put more effort into it without a doubt.",Average
930,resident-evil-3,daebu_char,"Mar  4, 2021",1,"An extremely reductive and uninspired reimagining of one of the most atmospheric and memorable entries in the Resident Evil franchise. The original Resident Evil 3: Nemesis (1999) is by far the most unsettling, intense, and haunting chapter of the original RE trilogy with very good pacing and exploration. It took what came before and injected steroids into it. It was also quite heavy on action, but not overwhelmingly so. What this 'reimagining' did is it got rid of the former (exploration & pacing) and overdosed on the latter (action). Just as Nemesis was removed from the title of the game, you might as well argue he was removed from the game entirely since he was reduced to an extremely scripted occurrence. What the players were teased with was open worlded exploration of Raccoon City as you'd be relentlessly chased by a Mr. X-like enemy. What ended up happening is that you're constantly being pushed in the direction you're supposed to go in an extremely streamlined version of the city (about 50% of the original locations are missing) and the player is incessantly bombarded by scripted action sequences that require barely any input from them to get through besides pressing ""Up.""

Gerçi bu sadece kağıt üzerinde AAA oyun, gerçekte ise Resident Evil 2 Remake: Nemesis DLC. Yazmaya başlamadan önce oyunu keyif alarak oynadığımı söylemek istiyorum ama benim keyif almam bu oyunu çok güzel bir oyun yapmıyor, hatalarını da ortadan kaldırmıyor. Oyunun hikayesini 4 saat 54 dakikada bitirdim, üstelik etrafı keşfederek ve bulduğum notları okuyarak ilerledim. Hızlı bir şekilde oynayanlar ve taktik bilenler bu oyunu çok rahat bir şekilde 3-4 saatte bitirebilir. 3-4 saatlik bir oyunun 60 dolardan çıkış yapması ise oldukça ilginç bir durum, çünkü senaryoyu bitirdikten sonra oyunda yapabileceğiniz hiçbir şey yok, hem de hiçbir şey. Yani 3-4 saatlik senaryoyu bitiriyorsunuz ve bu kadar, başka bir şey yok. Kullanılan oyun motoru Resident Evil 2'nin yeniden yapımında kullanılan motorla birebir aynı, grafikleri de aynı şekilde Resident Evil 2 ile aynı hiçbir gelişme yok. Vuruş hissiyatı Resident Evil 2 ile aynı olduğu için güzel, bölüm tasarımları ve Raccoon City de güzel bir atmosfere sahipti bu yüzden hoşuma gitti. Hikaye kısmında oyunun 1999'da çıkan sürümünü oynamadığım için yeniden yapım eski sürüme ne kadar sadık, hikayeye neler kattı veya neler eksiltti bilemeyeceğim ancak bu hali ile hikayenin pek de iyi olduğunu söyleyemem. Mesela Nemesis neden bizim peşimizde, onu bile öğrenemiyoruz. Oyunun başında telefonla konuşurken Nemesis birden duvarın içinden fırlıyor ve o andan oyunun sonunda öldüğü bölüme kadar bizi kovalıyor ancak neden ve ne amaçla bizi kovalıyor bir türlü anlayamıyoruz. Hikayenin kötü karakteri Nikolai da oldukça klişe bir kötü karakterdi o yüzden heyecan yaratmadı. Aynı şekilde ana karakterlerimiz Jill ve Carlos hakkında da neredeyse hiçbir şey bilmiyoruz. Jill S.T.A.R.S ekibine dahil bir polis memuru, Carlos da Umbrella şirketinin güvenlik güçleri için çalışıyor. Bu kadar, ana karakterlerimiz hakkında başka hiçbir şey bilmiyoruz. Hikaye bilinmezliklerle ve klişe karakterlerle dolu olduğu için oyuncu bir noktadan sonra ister istemez oyundan kopuyor. Nemesis her ne kadar bekleneni veremese de bence Resident Evil 2'deki Mr.X'ten daha iyiydi. Evet çok detaylı ve kapsamlı değildi ama hikayede göründüğü sahneler, Nemesis'le savaştığımız kısımların güzel oluşu bana göre Nemesis'i Mr. X'ten daha iyi bir karakter yaptı, ancak bu Mr. X'i kötü yapmıyor, bence Mr. X'te iyiydi ve Resident Evil 2'ye farklı ve güzel bir hava katıyordu. Grafik olarak dediğim gibi Resident Evil 2 ile neredeyse aynı, fena değil yani günümüz için. Optimizasyon olarak da Resident Evil 2'ye göre çok gelişmiş değil, oyunu 60 FPS'e sabitleyip öyle bitirdim ve genel olarak sabit 60 FPS değerini elde edebildim, ancak Residet Evil 2'deki gibi bazı sahnelerde yaşanan FPS düşüklüğü ve drop sorunu çok sık olmasa da bu oyunda da başıma geldi. Yazımın başında oyunu keyif alarak oynadığımı söylemiştim ancak neredeyse tüm yazı boyunca oyunu eleştirdim, nasıl oldu bu iş anlatayım: Evet oynarken keyif aldım çünkü Resident Evil 2'deki gibi oyunun bölüm tasarımı, Raccoon City'nin atmosferi ve vuruş hissiyatı hoşuma gitti ve Resident Evil evrenine yeni yeni giriş yaptığım için oyun muhtemelen benim için normalden daha keyifli hale geldi. Fakat söylediğim gibi; oyunu keyif alarak oynamış olmam oyunun eksikliklerini ortadan kaldırmıyor.

950,resident-evil-3,OldManGamerOMG,"Dec  4, 2020",7,"I thoroughly enjoyed this game, but I am also met with a few disappointments. My experience so far is just one playthrough, though a very involved one. My first playthrough consisted of eight hours and fifty four minutes. My clear time was one hour and thirty nine minutes. I was hoping to get an S rating, but saved too many times, eleven times in all. I would play an area, and once I knew it well, I would go back and zip through it. Now that I understand the game better, I will easily get that S rating, but now I get to try it out on a harder level. The game graphics are stellar. The gameplay itself is phenomenal. The story is engaging, and I even had a few 'come on man' out load moments at what was happening, but all in a good way. The hidden moral for those that catch it, excellent. Overall, my opinion is that this game is a must play, for Resident Evil and horror/action gamers alike. However, I am disappointed about a couple of things. The game is about half or even a third of that from Resident Evil 2. There is not additional content, which is not an issue except for the lack of length in the main game. The most crucial aspect that I enjoy most about Resident Evil is the puzzles, but this game has only two. The lickers are barely a thing in this game, and the diversity in enemies is noticeably limited. You have few repetitious zombie models, a new hunter (kind of), and the Nemesis in various forms. To get everything unlocked, as I did in Resident Evil 2, I will have to continually play the only game mode option provided, which is the story mode. Resident Evil 2 had a lot of bonus modes which were my gateway to finishing many of those in game achievements not displayed by steam. This in itself is not a bad thing, but when I am going to strive for the number of zombies killed, I feel this will become a tedious grind of reloading a save point to accomplish. To be honest, I am not sure I will do this, if it is too large a number of slaying needed after another playthrough or two.",Average

It's barely 6/10 with its plot holes and unsatisfying ending (at least for me, not going to spoiler here). The gameplay is 8/10. Graphics - 9/10 - played this game in November 2020, and, very often, I have thought about how the game would benefit from ray-tracing. Tremendously! From the technical side - the game was pretty clean  - no glitches, no bugs whatsoever. I don't know how to categorize my next thoughts... See, the game was quite short. It looks more like DLC than a full/complete game. Because if it's a game, then it requires another DLC to close some plot holes. I never played the original game (if ever was the one), but even for me, this game looks intentionally shortened (but for what purpose is not clear for me). What the reason for all that? Greedy publisher? Lazy developer? I give this game an overall score of 7,5/10, but because Metacritic does not allow decimals, I will shorten it to 7/10.",Average

For those who have not played the original, but started exploring the franchise now. This is not an ideal solution, but it is very normal.The game is not very long, but also not as short as I expected after all the hate that was poured on it.... Now about the pros and cons ...(+) I really loved the graphics of the game, but the texture of the water was incredibly awful(Rip off the hands of the person who made the water in this game). Great music and sounds. Very good work with the faces of the characters, their facial expressions and voices. Basically, this game has become an action, but from time to time I came across precisely the ""horror zones"", which gave a pleasant sense in contrast with action. Except for some very embarrassing cases in their stupid pathos, I really liked the staging in ""in-between videos"".(-) And now about the unpleasant ...What the hell, again, you have to fire your entire pistol clip INTO THE HEAD to kill a simple zombie? On normal difficulty. And then another half of the clip, because it got up again. This is fu***g stupid. Seriously, 2020 year today, why go back to this stupid way? It would be better to let more enemies, instead of this idiocy... Tough combat specialists Jill and Carlos run slower than a snail. Horror, whipping up the atmosphere, so as not to relax too much, I understand... but this is another logical stupidity. In contrast to past years, now this, seems to me, is just stupid decision... It also looks funny that a cool modern game does not allow you to jump over a small bush, forcing you to bypass this zone, according to the invented game script... The knife has become a useless piece of sh... scrap metal. Seriously, if you need to spend one and a half ammo clips on the simple enemy, with knife you can only check lying zombies for ""survivability"" or break the boxes.Jumping, flamethrower, rocket launcher, long guts tentacles, running on four legs. I may not understand the concept of horror that way, but it seems to me to make the main monster of the game a circus freak-transformer who climbs out of all the holes throughout the game - it was not the best solution. He infuriated me more and more often, rather than frightened. But I still got a certain amount of pleasure from fighting with him. I also liked the rail-gun very much.

It's a run and gun game with not much time to really explore and soak in the levels, unlike RE2 with the police station, sewers, lab etc There's no atmosphere in this one, pretty generic beside the opening city which is cool with all the signs and stores. There are almost no puzzles of any kind, there are light environmental puzzles but not too much effort to solve. I can't say much about the story it's standard fare, trying to escape the city/find the vaccine and get away from Nemesis with some zombie fighting here and there. I've not played the original. They basically used all the assets from RE2 Remake here, with different skins. Zombies don't break apart like in RE2, much more simplistic damage.--It has stutter in the early game where there are lots of moving parts, no matter the settings you'll get stutter.

998,resident-evil-3,AntonioLettino,"Aug 29, 2020",8,"Badass Jill 21 years after the release of the third part of the game in the Resident Evil universe, Resident Evil 3: Nemesis, Capcom redefines the approach to survival horror by adding a really solid dose of action to its newest child. You can even wonder how much Resident Evil 3 is still a survival horror, and how much a full-fledged action game with a horror storyline.Nevertheless, the Japanese company Capcom is to be commended for the perfect reproduction of its game in the modern realities of games after more than two decades, without deviating in any way from the standards that modern games must meet today. The story presented in Resident Evil 3 is an adventure for one long night, full of intense and strong impressions, because from the first minutes of the game we are thrown into a whirlwind of action, which with short breaks does not let go until the end of the game.It is a completely closed story in which it will be in vain to look for a field of possibilities for free and undisturbed exploration of the area. Although there are numerous collectibles here and there, weapon upgrades or documents supplementing the background of the events, it is completely optional and a narrow group of items. Capcom does not hide for a moment that their goal is to confront the player with the growing groups of dead bodies, the vision of destroying Raccoon City and facing the monstrous hybrid, which is the Nemesis of the Special Tactics And Rescue Service unit.Well, it was the greatest emotions in the public space that oscillated around the terrifying creature of Nemesis - T Type and its impact on the gameplay in the game. If you put Tyrant T-103 and Nemesis - T Type together, in the end the first monster fares much better than the second. Nemesis makes an episodic appearance in the game, and apart from one and the only time he hunted Jill Valentine spontaneously, each such encounter ended in a clash between the two. In the case of the T-103, this was out of the question. Tyrant pursued the hero for most of the game, and the only option was to escape, not to fight Jill with Nemesis. And these skirmishes belong to the most spectacular element of production. And despite the apparent difference in size, Jill Valentine was in no way inferior to the mutant in determination, and at times you could ask who is the monster here?Thanks to this structure of the game, it significantly changed its reception. Namely, the place of terror caused by the chasing monster was replaced by action and the desire to destroy the opponent. Such emotions and their reception by the player in survival horror titles are very important. Whether such a presentation of the gameplay captures something in Resident Evil 3, everyone has to answer personally. There is only one location in the game that is intimidating with its arrangement - Spencer Memorial Hospital, although even it is not as big as the Raccoon Police Department from Resident Evil 2. What deserves separate praise is the way in which both these parts - the second and the third - intertwine with each other and complement the story of the game with past events. Thanks to that, after completing Resident Evil 3, you can smoothly move to the previous installment, even despite the different dynamics that characterize both of these titles.As usual, excellent sound, scary music, great graphics with very well-used light-shadow and fun lighting perfectly complement the background of the game. If you can make any accusations to Capcom about their work, there is a price-plot correlation. In Resident Evil 3 there is only one model of fun, which is the Jill Valentine campaign + records like shooting 100 dead bodies with a gun. The plot is short, there is no need to hide it, the record breakers completed it in less than two hours, and the price of PLN 249 for the remake is a bit excessive.Fortunately, I managed to get a copy for just over PLN 120, which I consider to be the appropriate value. Anyway, this is another very good title in the achievements of Capcom and despite the fact that it is ""only"" a remake, it perfectly complements the almost 25-year-old universe that has devoted fans around the world. It only remains to wait for the creators to follow the blow and do the same with the ""four"".8/10",Positive

1006,resident-evil-3,KillinInstinct,"Aug 11, 2020",4,"I wouldn't recommend this game at full price, only buy during sales. I didn't play the original but I've seen a lot of comparison videos that explain the differences and shows which enemies are missing/have been reworked and which locations have been cut. I genuinely dislike this, since the title is REmake and it's told to be a remake. The Map for the whole game feels small compared to the RE2 map and apparently also compared to the OG RE3. The game has too many scripted events where only holding down W gets followed up by a small cinematic, then the cycle gets repeated multiple times in the game. I would have liked to have been able to go to the rumored clock tower, the park, or the graveyard or fight the spiders, crows, or other gamma beasts. Nemesis is cool in the town segment but loses his intimidating aura after you've figured out he can be one-shot with the electrocutes or just 1 grenade or a barrel. The model looks sick though and the same goes for Jill's model. I didn't like Carlos's look, so I used the classic outfit for him. Obviously the game's graphics have been improved and look just as awesome as RE2's graphics since they're using the same engine. There weren't really any puzzles present that I had expected because of OG RE3 reputation of them and was let down by the sheer easiness of the two only puzzles of the game. The dodge mechanic felt nice to use but her movement speed felt slow at times, so spamming the dodge felt quicker a lot of the time. The game was VERY linear. There was mostly a straight line you had to walk and the Nemesis boss fights felt pretty boring to me.  The whole game felt like a scripted event to me, which wasn't very cool. For example, when Nemesis pulled me headfirst out of the sewers and just looked at me after he threw me was dumb but the building that Nemesis set on fire was so boring and just plain stupid since there was a segment where he wouldn't even follow you in, which was a complete turn-off. I'm an extreme graphics junky so games like these of Ubisoft games pull me in easily, but this time I was proven, that even games with awesome graphics can suck or just be boring to play and have 0 replayability. All in all the game was ok but it doesn't count as a standalone game to me and felt like a DLC. And I don't even want to talk about REsistance, which I haven't even played once because I cared so little for it.",Negative

1013,resident-evil-3,jordanlearmonth,"Jul 24, 2020",8,"Contrary to all the reviews (which are mostly positive actually) out there, RE3 has a lot to offer if you only stop to look. It does depend on how you play, and I have already spent more hours in RE3 during my first playthrough on hardcore mode than I did in RE2. In many ways, RE3 is a much superior entry to RE2, which jumped up to number one last year in my list of favorite RE titles that I’ve played for almost twenty years. RE3 is gonna be my favorite now with RE4 and RE2remake following it.Jill’s is one of the most gorgeous character designs I’ve ever seen in a video game. Her attire is realistic and attractive, and so is her sassy attitude. And I’m just gonna say it—Carlos’s redesign and personality are just too damn sexy. Moreover, their relationship feels so true. The dialogs and character qualities, from when she smirks at Carlos, “I know how to use a radio”, when she reconciles with him, “I know we didn’t get off to a good start” and when they briefly part ways and share a longing stare, are very well done. There is so much depth to Jill’s character and others’ as well.The reimagined Racoon city is spectacular. The stunning posters and the subtle hint of the still extant life is remarkable, all the while offering a sense of foreboding, which is truly enjoyable. The world is highly enriched compared to RE2. Makes me stop and look each time. Moreover, RE3 has some of the best music I’ve ever heard in video games, especially in an RE title. It’s truly amazing. The attention to detail such as Jill’s ever-increasing bruises as the situation intensifies, is astounding. The facial graphics are relatively sharper than those of the RE2 Remake. Reading the documents in RE3 was ten times more satisfying than reading those of RE2’s, as they are much longer.The dodge mechanic provides a much-needed gameplay addition to the intense situations the remake throws you into. The perfect dodge and the dodge counter, which can certainly prove to be an exciting challenge to master and ups the critical damage tenfold, are extremely gratifying.I did have just one issue, or something that you can’t help but notice and that was all the jump scares and the realistically terrifying zombies that were new and scarier when RE2 remake came out, but a little underwhelming when playing RE3, but that was to be expected—nothing that makes the experience dull in any way, coz RE3 delivers a more intense gameplay that balances those scares. If RE3 had been released before RE2, people would be saying very different things right now.Lastly, I encourage hardcore fans to do their first playthrough on hardcore like I did to truly enjoy the game for what it is. This would then unlock nightmare mode, beating which unlocks inferno mode, and these two are infuriatingly and terrifyingly delightful, since everything changes and there are enemies dropping everywhere. They also become very aggressive and faster. Shaking them off does not have a 100% success rate either.RE3 is a stunning remake and a refreshing departure from RE2’s environments and for true fans the price never matters, but if you’re in doubt, pick it up on a sale. I can assure you if you love survival horror and a little more intense gameplay than RE2 remake, then you will love RE3. On another note, Resistance is loads of fun and do give it a shot. It’s highly addictive. Capcom have truly outdone themselves this time and are constantly demonstrating their prowess in improving upon their stunning RE engine with each new installment. Thank you for delivering another great game.",Positive
1014,resident-evil-3,ImBadAtLife,"Jul 21, 2020",4,"This is a good game ... IF you have never played the first RE3 (or BH3). Let's start with the pros: -Great Graphics-Few Glitches (encountered absolutely none)- comfortable controls. Now, when you buy a game that is a remake of a game that has the main antagonist in the title, you would expect that antagonist to be stunning, right? He was in the first game, not so much in this one ... Nemesis is now only in scripted events, instead of tracking you down the whole game. Now, don't give me some **** about the engine not being able to handle it, because the same engine did something similar with tyrant in the RE2 remake. Also, his final form is just ... pathetic. Now, another thing, Racoon City is no longer open-world. Moving on, one of the things this game suffers from most is the survival-horror mechanics. They feel like they just give you barely any resources. This would be fine, except that they don't give you enough for either. The knife does **** compared to the knife in RE7, so you are forced to use ammo-costing weapons. Usually, I can avoid attacks most of the time, but every once-in-a-while I get hit, and those hits stack-up after a while. The difficulty setting are out of whack. Assisted (Easy) basically hands the game over to you, Hardcore (Hard) is **** impossible, and Normal (Medium) is like Assisted at sometimes and is like Hardcore at other times. Another important mechanic of survival-horror games is also **** up here, inventory. Inventory was only a problem for me ONCE in this entire goddamn game! But even though the survival-horror mechanics and the difficulty is out-of-whack, nothing compares to RE3 remakes most fatal flaw, the campaign length. On RE Revelations 2, I spent 6 hours playing. On RE7, I spent 10 hours and 15 minutes playing, and on RE2 Remake, I spent 4 and 1/2 hours on Leon's campaign, and 4 hours and 15 minutes on Claire's 2nd Run, plus an additional 40 minutes trying to beat the 4th survivor minigame (for a total of 9 hours and 25 minutes)  and I spent 4 hours and 40 minutes on this game. I saved up for this game. i pay about $900 rent for an apartment. I spent $50 dollars for this game. A game that lasted me under 5 hours. I also pre-ordered it. All I got for pre-ordering were two skins. That's enough about the campaign, now for the online mode: RE Resistance. This is the saving grace of RE3 Remake. It's nothing special, but is WAY better than the campaign. You're either a Mastermind who sets up traps and controls zombies and mutants to kill off the survivors. Survivors try to ... well ... survive, while also solving puzzles. It's not very fun with strangers on the Internet, but if you can get a few friends on Discord, it's a nice distraction if you're getting bored with other online games. An annoying thing is that you cannot gain achievements while in private matches, but I guess it makes sense, but it's still annoying. Overall, campaign is a 2 or 3 while the online is a 5 or 6, so that would justify a 4 rating.",Negative

1036,resident-evil-3,Pedro_Batista91,"Jun 23, 2020",7,"RESIDENT EVIL 3 IS A GREAT REREADING, BUT DISAPPOINTING LIKE A REMAKE As a new game, RESIDENT EVIL 3 is fantastic even with a short but rich story compared to the original one, the story of Jill and Carlos are well built, however, if you think that you will play the same game from 1999, you will be disappointed. As a longtime fan, I was open-minded, and I enjoyed this new experience and I will tell you why. For those who are a longtime fan like me, it's a plate full of seeing the most iconic female character in the franchise and, in my view, from games alongside Lara Croft, Jill Vallentine and to my surprise, Carlos Oliveira a legitimate BR wins greater visibility within the game, RE3 2020 could very well have two campaigns, as Carlos 2020 is much more iconic and striking than Carlos 1999, apart from Nicholai and Mikhail who are striking characters in the franchise, Nemesis is more striking in the classic, because it chased you where you were going, which made it famous for one of the greatest video game classics, already in the reinterpretation, Nemesis is treated as a simple monster, despite giving work in some points, they could have given more visibility within about the game. The beginning of the game puts you in the first person in the skin of Jill, remembering the vision of the camera of RE7 (which is a big game and revived the franchise that 6 almost killed), the game already starts frantic and running from Nemesis, one of points that I always missed in the classic, is not showing from the beginning how Jill arrives in the warehouse where Dario Rosso is, what was well told in the re-reading and outside the optimization of the game that is VERY GOOD, even on less robust PCs, you can play with quality and good performance. But every big game, there is always at least one disappointment and in RE3 2020 there were a few, what they did with Brad was extremely erroneous, because one of the classic scenes is the death of the STARS agent in the hands of Nemesis and I thought that Marvin could be better explored and the reason for the bite despite having had a good idea, but the execution was bad, besides, some iconic points of the classic were left out like Raccoon Park next to the hospital, more puzzles and complexes, because the The existing ones are very easy to carry out, a bigger exploration of the RPD that could be done with Carlos as it happened in this game, the Grave Digger, an iconic monster that Jill faces before arriving at Trem / Bonde and the incredible Clock Tower, these last two made a LOT of LACK within the rereading, which could give a longevity to the story which is short, but the classics were also, RE2 and RE3 classic, you can reset it in less than 1hr, I will already reset both games below u an hour, but of course, after unlocking the game's strongest weapons that are endless. RESIDENT EVIL 3 of 2020 I took more than 1hr and 7 minutes to reset, but the first time, it took me more than 7hrs, because I took advantage and explored each point on the map and compared it with the classic, and doing so, left me with the impression that Raccoon City in 1999 was larger than in 2020. BUY if you have an open mind, because it is a game that you can enjoy a lot until you complete all the achievements, until the moment of this analysis, I lack two where one of them, requires you to end in HELL MODE, this game deserves to be played and nothing better than drawing your own conclusions and a heart tip for the general, never go for a journalist's note, because most don't show what the game is, the review of the PC Gamer gringa is just ridiculous, this game doesn't it is a score of 10, but it is not a score of 5.8, I don't think it's better than the 2019 RE2 that has loopholes in history. If CAPCOM were not lazy with the 2 titles of 2019 and 2020, they could win the game of the year award, the famous GOTY, CAPCOM lost to itself in 2019. Anyway, it is a game that will divide opinions, I LIKED IT A LOT , was it a good rereading, a remake? He ran away from that idea. Who's playing like the classic? Simple, play the classic, as it is a game worth revisiting over the years, RESIDENT EVIL 3 is a beautiful retelling, with a better story, but fails like Remake, because they cut several points of the classic. What makes me happy, is that we can see either in a Revelations or in sequences of the main franchise, the image of Jill and Carlos that deserve to be further explored as they were in this RE3. Chris, although he likes it a lot, he's already saturated, he appeared at 5, 6 and 7, okay, right? Let Code Verônica, RE4 Remake come with a good story this time. And if there is a game that does not need to make a remake, but rather a COMPLETE REVIEW, it is Resident Evil 6, as this almost killed the franchise and should be remade and interconnect with the history of 7. GradesGameplay: 9.5 / 10Story: 9,5 / 10Optimization: 10/10Fidelity to the classic: 4/10Overall: 8/10",Average

El error mas fatal que le veo al juego es querer ver a Jill como la super heroína americana, invencible y hasta capaz de salvar una ciudad infestada de monstruos y zombies. Debo aclarar primero que Jill en RE3 de 1999, siempre su objetivo era escapar de la ciudad, donde en el canon original falló 2 veces antes de que Carlos lograra conseguir un helicóptero, el estrés por cada intento fallido de conseguir ese helicóptero era fatal para Jill. Entonces teniendo esto claro y volviendo a RE3 de 2020, su objetivo nunca es escapar de la ciudad si se cruzo con un helicóptero, era casualidad. Entonces vamos al peor error de RE3 cuando ella despierta después de que Carlos le inyecta el antídoto, empiezan todos a hablar de que la ciudad se puede salvar, Jill va por el antídoto con el cual se salvaran todos los ciudadanos de Raccoon City, jajajaja... esto es lo mas incoherente que se puede escuchar, estamos en medio de una pandemia por el covid-19 y así se tenga el antídoto, recrear esa vacuna tomaría meses (lo han dicho los medios de comunicación con el covid-19), ya que se debe primero crear una vacuna-inversa o sea ver que componentes tiene el antídoto para poderlo recrear a la perfección, y ahora la super heroína sale con que va a salvar la ciudad con eso, piensa llevar la vacuna al pentágono y después de que allá pasado no se un año y tenga no se 750 000 vacunas, viajar al pasado (25 de septiembre de 1999) y salvar la ciudad, porfavor, para ese momento el virus estaría esparcido por todo el mundo, que argumento tan malo, que error fatal. Raccoon City en ese estado lo mejor es eliminarla con el misil nuclear no hay otra salida y Jill junto con los demás a escapar de la ciudad.",Average

But disappointment set in quick. The game throws you right into the action. No plot development, no slow buildup, it starts with an impressive chase scene and rarely relents. For the first 30 minutes the game feels a bit like an open world game, and with Nemesis chasing the player, the player has to adapt, conserve ammo, pick his battles and is generally forced to play in a way he normally wouldn't. In other words: survival horror the way it should be. The claustrophobic feeling of RE2 and RE7 is lost, but the city overrun with zombies is sufficiently different and scary on its own. But once you finish the first part of the game, things come to a grinding halt. During the quieter moments, RE usually offered so brain teasing puzzles. None of that here. This is a pure shoot em up, but sadly not a good one. For an action game, it's too slow and simplistic. For a horror game, it's not scary enough (or at all) and for a story driven game, for a survival game it's too easy and without puzzles, and for a story driven game, there's simply no plot to speak of. So what exactly was the idea behind this game? A quick cash grab, yes.Add to that an unlikable heroine, who is just snotty for most of the story, an unimposing villain and tryhard simp Carlos, and the cutscenes become a chore.They even downgraded the physics and gore from RE2.This game feels incomplete. I don't mind the short length, if they had given us different paths to explore. That would have increased replay value. As it is, this is a game for speed runners and no one else.All that being said, is there anything good? Graphics and sound design, yes. The new evade mechanic is kinda cool. Some of the mods on nexusmods are fun. And that's about it.",Average

But it was good. I enjoyed my 8 hour playthrough, because it always had you doing something. No matter what it was, it was still something to get you through the game in a modern, yet nostalgic way. Yes, there aren't any puzzles in this like the original, but I don't think that was Capcoms intention. They just wanted the story to be revived in high quality, incredible visuals. Honestly some of the best visuals ive seen this year. And the game overall was played out well by the actors. The only thing I don't like was the exclusion of both the Clock Tower interior and the Park. As they had some large significance with the original, I hoped to see it in modern day graphics, but no. They're both not present unfortunately. But nonetheless, the game is a blast to play with some good mechanics and Nemesis is frightening, although you might not see him as much as you'd expect, his character model is high quality and set with brilliant animation.

CAPCOM could simply put the player controlling Jill in his nightmare enjoying the classic part and after the explosion she tried to open that door from the beginning but without success, then she would be surrounded and attacked by the zombies and then she would wake up with a call from Brad the two would meet Nemesis would go after them and Brad would sacrifice himself to save Jill that would be a well done reimagination intro, and look at the idea that came to my mind while I was in the toilet, is it that CAPCOM is so lacking in creativity? We will not forget the scene where the helicopter q is going to save Jill explodes without any explanation since Nemesis q is responsible for the explosion and walks towards Jill without the bazooka: / if CAPCOM wanted more action on the scene, it was only to have left Nemesis with the bazooka, then after he shot the helicopter while reloading for the second shot in the meantime, Jill would put the car to run over Nemesis, plummet with him down the building, Carlos would appear, take the bazooka dropped by Nemesis and knock him down ready CAPCOM the scene would be contextualized: / I could go on but it would extend and a lot, it would practically script the whole game ... anyway ... if you are a fan of the game you probably already bought it and probably share the same disappointment, now, if you haven't bought it yet and really want to play expect a 50% promotion because I don't agree with CAPCOM on this",Average

The only real new additions are the dodge move (which becomes a counterattack when you take control of Carlos), which still facilitates the game too much in my humble opinion and mimics the one present in the original chapter, and the nightmare and inferno modes that increase the difficulty of the game, they change positions to some objects and add enemies. In my opinion, Capcom was wrong to put another team on the project, it would have been better to wait to finish on the 2nd or even simply put the same team to work on both, you don't change the winning team.

She hits one game and spoils another, Resident Evil 2 Remake is a thousand times better, but the detail is that my favorite Resident Evil is Resident Evil 3: Nemesis. I as a fan thought she had learned it at once. But that game made me cry with disgust. Don't spend your money on this game. It's not even worth your time. 1.30 hour of play. It was the worst hours spent in my life. I have no words to describe how much I cried when I saw all the garbage that was put in that game. Capcom deceives you in 30 minutes.

(I do think that if they did something better than the original it was Carlos' appearance.) So much potential in one of my favorite games of all time that make me love the RE franchise, and so badly rushly, poorly executed just to deliver games consistently in an acceptable time period for $$$. I'll get it that's what a company should always prioritize right?  But hey! Don't you worry they are already ""working"" on their next prank which we already know it is not going to be the fan claimed Code Veronica. Well, the game is about 5 -6 hrs. I never felt the game was challenging not even in managing resources or punishing for bad management/decisions or just playing bad. On my  first playthrough on hardcore I've got 72% completion and my box full of ammo, herbs and resources. I can even use my multiple saves to farm records... They prefered to cut puzzles and storytelling to avoid working on a lot of different scenarios but we got a more ""action based"" if by dodging and always having a linear and restricted scenario where you should always be rushing forward you can called it that. They tried a weird hybrid RE that attempted to bring new players and old ones like if they never learned for a disaster recipe that is. (Note that if by reducing/removing the 100+ hollywood explosions, zombies with weapons and never dying characters on crazy **** situations on RE6  I did liked that game and I think the progression system, the shop, customization to fit different play styles and different stories merging together were GREAT) RE3 2020 never excels in absolutely nothing but well it IS fun and I like it, you already know the mechanics, they even recycled the stupid zombies from RE2 for fcks sake the same fckn faces and outfits, so lame. Well guys you will get a ""cinematic experience"" on this RE3 but keep your expectations low. The game is fun just very disappointing in a lot of ways. I won't even cover the stupid multiplayer that in a few weeks there should be close to no one playing it, if not sooner, that ""replaced"" the fckn awesome Mercenaries so yeah' if this is on your wishlist you can grab it on sale.

Admittedly, the game is short not nearly as challenging as its 1999 original. I do think that this is a good remake, however, I wish that there was a little more challenge and some of the original puzzles. The game does feel slightly incomplete without the challenging puzzles. Nemesis is horrifying and intimidating, even better than the original, but I didn't feel like I was constantly on the run this time as compared to the original. The game runs excellent on PC at a solid 60 frames with no issues, and I run a mid-range rig. Comparing this to Resident Evil 2 remake, it does feel a bit empty, but the game was never long in the first place. Pairing it with Resident Evil Resistance was a nice addition and in my opinion justifies the price point. Overall, my only complaints is that the game is not as challenging, wish Nemesis would always chase you, more puzzles, and more outfits and cosmetics would be nice. My friend and I discussed the price point of the game and the fact that it came with two games instead of one. We came to this conslusion that it would have been nice to sell Resident Evil 3 alone at $40 (instead of $60) and sell Resident Evil Resistance at $40, and if you wanted both you could buy a bundle at $60.

Removed, not replaced.All the puzzles are gone. All of them. Entire boss fights are gone like the gravedigger. No cemetery at all, no clocktower (what?!), no park, all gone.

Everything is incredibly linear, exploration is not encouraged as there's nothing to find worth caring about and the final boss fight is not only insultingly easy but incredibly lame and unsatisfying.RE2 does everything this game does but better and gives you more of it.It's incredibly short, feels bare minimum, cut corners by dropping half the original game and recycled as many assets as possible in all the worst ways.Oh, and no mercenary mode to even attempt to give it some more content or replayability or SOMETHING.

This is DLC, not a 60$ release. It seems like it was pushed out to show off RE Resistance. The game took forever to get the graphic settings right and even then you had to mod the EXE to fix simple things like the zombies of in the distance being locked dto 30 FPS when your game is running at 60. I was hoping they would do right by this game, because this is the same feeling we all had back in 99. But this is worse. They reused a lot of assets from 2 and downgraded on that game, such as the gore system. They had no reason to rush this especially if they had Resistance on deck. They should have pushed Resistance as a free to play release while continuing to develop this title. I really wanted to see them expand upon this original story as they did with the 2nd remake, but they did the opposite and cut a lot of it out and turned back toward the direction of RE 5 and 6, almost as if they completely blocked out all the praise they received the last couple of years (specifically last year). And for some reason the game just shifts tone in the last part of the game and turns into a typical Capcom anime game. It's clear that the B team screwed up and the A team was forced to come in to fix the mess after RE2 wrapped up, I want to know the story of what happened. Its really unfortunate that the canon suffers as well. I wouldn't recommend paying more than $30 for this.",Average

Make it shine.But .. there is nothing to explore, to seek solutions to problems. You always know where to go, and if you forgot, Carlos will tell you, or you in the corridor.In this game you do not need to think and remember.They сut costumes.

1165,resident-evil-3,Fox_Vanilla,"Apr  4, 2020",4,"This review is from someone who pre-ordered the original RE3 back in 1999 and played it to death. It's hard to call Resident Evil 3 a remake, there's so much missing content it's more of a reimagining than a remake. Overall the game feels unfinished if you've played the original 1999 release of Resident Evil 3. Capcom set the standard for what a remake should be with the Resident Evil Remake release on GameCube back in 2002. A remake is supposed to recreate the original game and EXPAND on the story arcs and lore. Not remove it entirely! What's missing:-No live selection system (which KILLS replayability). This was a huge feature of RE3 where you made your own choices throughout the game. Kind of like pick a path.-No clock tower section.-No Raccoon Park section.-No cemetery section.-No gravedigger worm battle.-No dead factory section, so we have yet **another** secret underground umbrella lab. How trite.-Nemesis sections often feel more like I'm watching a movie than playing a game. The fabulous Mr. X stalking mechanics from Resident Evil 2 Remake are NOT implemented here with Nemesis.-No spiders.-No freeze rounds.-Greatly reduced puzzle sections.-*SPOILERS* No Barry flying the chopper in the end so it's like his character has been erased from the lore (speaking of the ending the nuclear bomb strike was completely watered down and utterly KILLED the emotional impact of seeing Raccoon City destroyed that the original game showcased. You were actually left feeling sad at the end of the original, but I just felt ripped off at the end of this so called ""remake"".What they did actually include in the game I absolutely loved. The first hour of the game is fantastic although the mesmerizing FMV of the PlayStation original which showcases the zombies overrunning the city has been completely watered down and gives the zombie apocalypse far less impact. It has been replaced by a cheaply made and jarring live action movie using real actors. There's just too much ripped out of the original game for me to think this was a worthy effort. It feels like an extended DLC for RE2 Remake. Overall I'm disappointed at Capcom. The game feels like a rushed cash grab and is a heartbreaking missed opportunity to have created something really, really special with the new implementation of a live selection system especially.",Negative

A lot of screenshots are from this locations, which are not fully playable. You just press W and watch the cutscenes.2) All the good parts of the city were explored in the Demo. If I knew that before I would not play the god damn demo.

Welcome to the RE3 ""Remake"" the **** repeads Others ppl already pointed out what exactly was removed and I could copy/paste that but ... iam not Capcom. Lets instead just say, they cuted out 60% of the original story & areas. Even worser - they remove the mercenaries mod. The original was criticized as being too short not without a reason but the merc-mod made the whole thing ""more bearable""The only reason for removing this mod was greed. They added the resistance-mod just for selling lootboxes and they will bring back the merc-mod as DLC because they are greedy little F%&/tards and they know the fans miss it. The two main excuses for all of  that  (since the RE2:RE) are- the game looks sooo great- its a ""remake"" not a remaster To the first i just can say that is no suprise...after 2 decades of hard&software development and it excuse absolut nothing. Half of the work comes from me by improoving my system.The ""Remake""excuse is the biggest pile of bull**** i hear so far. In wich universe is that an excuse for removing existent content or anything else? They could even add MORE into the game even if its ""just"" a remake so just stfu u breathing brainfarts Do u remember Jill's stupit speech about human greed @ the end of the game? Both Remakes AND the remaster version of part 1 just exist because of that. The modder community was allready working on a hd remake for the first part but then Capcom showes up. Unable to accept that someone is getting something for FREE announcing they are allready working on it...such a suprise. I allready hear someone agumenting *your just a hater, i think its a ""masterpice""*My answer is u have 0 agruments and your existens is just a waste of air. U couldn't differentiate a masterpice from a  bunch of **** even if you hold them in your hands. Those ""oneliner"" aren't worth a penny. F$%§ all these fakefans on youtube ""reviewing"" that game and the first thing u see in the discription is a link for a discound if you buy it @ their partner, thanking for ""sponsoring""Its so disgusting how some ppl try to make money by lying in our face, adertising a product and  ""reviewing"" a product are 2 different pairs of shoes. This game is just another shameless cash grab and not worth 60$ They reduced the difficulty. S is now the max rank (not S+) so every causual gamer can now run trough the game  in lesser than a hour and gaining max rank while  using the infinite ammo waepons - thinking hes Rambo himself. Maybe they will add S+ later (like mercenaries) but who knows? This stupit autosave & checkpoint function alerts u just before something happens anddestroys any tension, the missing ink ribbons destroy the tension too you can now save how often u want (yea it reduce your rank but who cares @the first run)I allready hear someone agumenting*nagnag, u have to play it on the hardest difficulty, there is no autosave nagnag*...yea but u have to play through to get to that point u breathing brainfart and all tension is gone after the first run on hardcore.The changes of the behavior of Jill are stupit. She acts like Alice (strong female character chosen to rescue the world) and sometimes like a little teenager without any fear, flirting with carlos right next to the apocalypse of the world. After the first quarter she's bored by nemesis, he's annoying and not a danger anymore. And the changes on Carlos the ""elite""-merc...dropping his fully functional rocketlauncher one arm length next to nemesis.

1193,resident-evil-3,Sholva,"Apr  6, 2020",9,"Once again, Capcom brings another great game on the amazing RE Engine, this time in the form of Resident Evil 3. While the previous remake, RE 2, was more slow paced and conservative, RE 3 quickly switches gears from the start and it really feels more focused on letting the player be a bit more proactive towards the different enemies; we can dodge now, even in a “perfect dodge” way if properly timed, so that’s already a pretty good indicator of the intentions Capcom had with this remake. Just like in the original RE3, dodging can be an interesting way of dealing with some enemies, but also risky if we have yet to master it; fortunately this time around the mechanics behind it aren’t as obnoxious as in the original game. When it comes to PC exclusive settings and other stuff, any PC review should mention at least some of these, when it comes to performance, control settings and keybinds, etc. Very much like RE 2 Remake, the game offers a wide array of graphical settings and the controls are pretty customizable, even quite left handed friendly. On the performance side of things, the game runs flawlessly on my Ryzen 5 3600 and GTX 1070, even on max settings, but as it happened with the previous game, the Volumetric Lighting can be a bit taxing in certain scenes, but dropping it to Medium solves the issue while not losing much quality on such volumetric effects. As for the dreaded “short” duration of the game many people are afraid of, on my first run I spent, according to my save, around 7 and a half hours, and around 10 in total (as the save seems to only count time for essential stuff and no other time spent in menus or what not, I guess, not sure). Anyway, what this means is that if you finished the game on your first run in like 2 hours, you skipped a lot of the fun and exploration, so that’s on you. The game felt to me, on the first run, just as long as RE 2 remake, all things considered. RE2 Remake on the other hand, I felt it had a lot of wasted potential with the A/B and B/A scenarios, meaning that once you did let’s say Claire A and Leon B, there was no need to do the reverse…none, it was the same, with some plot inconsistencies even regarding some of the Birkin fights. In any case, that didn’t stop me from considering RE 2 Remake a very amazing game, and it is. For RE3 Remake I felt that this time the story seems even more consistent to me, and coherent. It may feel shorter for those who spent the same amount of time doing A/B back in RE 2, but no…it really isn’t any much shorter than RE 2 Remake, just like the originals, both could be completed in a similar time back then, especially when speed running. For this game I also felt that characters like Carlos have been vastly improved, to the point that now he feels like a very well written character and not the...whatever that was on the original game. Really good job there with Carlos, Capcom, his character development really made me enjoy him a lot, in a very good way. The rest of the cast is also very well written, even those whose stay is more brief than others so yeah, solid cast for this remake, most of the original game's characters are very well written and dubbed, at least in english. Sound design is very decent too in this game, and compared to RE2 Remake I felt that the music here in RE 3 is more varied and very cohesive with the rest of the action packed situations we find ourselves in. Great job in general with the soundtrack, something not many reviews seem to mention, really enjoyed it. All in all, I’m still face palming heavily myself after having read some of the most bizarre “professional” reviews for the game (like that pathetic 58 score PC Gamer review, if you can call that thing a PC game review, with no mention on performance or PC specific stuff, to be very honest with you here), but luckily from what I’ve seen on Metacritic, from like 90 professional critics reviews, not too many are that low, so they seem like pretty much outliers. In general the game is quite solid, and if you have any reason to believe it isn’t, well good for you, but I myself had a pretty amazing blast playing this game, and hopefully Capcom ignores those people fixated on bland nostalgia and they keep making remakes like these. That seems to be the intention here, they seem to be fixing some of the inconsistencies in the original stories for the main characters and all that, so hopefully they continue revamping these mainline games and we can see more remakes.",Positive

It is noted that the team was not the same as Resident Evil 2 Remake.I cut the first time playing in standard 4 hours to turn it, dying no more than 3 times.Does not meet the expectation expected around history.The gameplay with Carlos respects the original game since that part was action and here he respects it and redoubles it making the part with Carlos more interesting.The physics of the game are nothing compared to Re2 Remake. He has no commitment to the puzzles, the game is totally linear. Many cinematics.Nemesis: I liked the remake of phase 1, well used the graphics but phase 2 no longer respects what we expected, phase 2 is a dog with 4 legs ... nothing to do with the original nemesis.The fights are few and they are Scripted, it is not like Mr X of the Re2 Remake that followed you all over the police station without counting the save rooms. The game is one more action, it is not survival horror like the 2 remake. They had time to do it and they did it badly in a hurry and reluctantly, all pretext to get the Project Resistance that comes from Bonus with the Resident Evil 3 Remake and the price totally exaggerated. It is not worth at least in Argentina 4,200 Argentine pesos. As always Capcom does 2 good 3 bad ... they went back again with the titles of Resident Evil. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Esto es una reseña 100% Sincera. Decepcionado de este juego tan esperado. Se nota que el equipo no fue el mismo que hizo Resident Evil 2 Remake.Corto primera vez jugando en estandar 4 horas para darlo vuelta, muriendo nada mas 3 veces.No cumple con la expectativa que se esperaba en torno a historia.La jugabilidad con Carlos respeta el juego original ya que esa parte era de acción y aca la respeta y la redobla haciendo que la parte con Carlos sea mas interesante.Las fisicas del juego no son nada comparadas al Re2 Remake. No tiene empeño en los puzzles, totalmente lineal el juego. Muchas cinematicas.Nemesis: Me gusto el remake de la fase 1, bien aprovechado los graficos pero la fase 2 ya no respeta lo que esperabamos, fase 2 es un perro con 4 patas... nada que ver con el nemesis original.Las peleas son pocas y son Scripteadas, no es como Mr X del Re2 Remake que te seguia por toda la comisaria sin contar los save room. El juego es uno mas de acción, no es survival horror como el 2 remake. Tuvieron tiempo de hacerlo y lo hicieron mal a las apuradas y sin ganas, todo pretexto para sacar el Project Resistance que viene de Bonus con el Resident Evil 3 Remake y el precio totalmente exagerado. No lo vale por lo menos en Argentina 4.200 Pesos Argentinos. Como siempre Capcom hace 2 bien 3 mal... se fueron para atras nuevamente con los titulos de Resident Evil.",Average

Я познакомился с серией resident evil именно на первой плойке играя в resident evil 3 nemesis и она мне понравилась. Мало патронов, мало аптечек, сохранение на пишущую ленту, коей, опять же не много, под соусом охотника-""терминатора"" по имени немезида который гнался за тобой по пятам. 20 лет назад ЭТО РАБОТАЛО! Да чего там - год назад это тоже прекрасно работало в ремейке второй части, которую лично я считаю лучшей частью серии resident evil и если вы не знакомы с ней и хотите поиграть в нее, то лучше начать с ремейка 2019 года. в резике 20года есть много патронов, много аптечек, нет ленты и есть один большой клоун по имени немезида который пытается веселить вас на протяжении 5 часов, все бы ничего, да только он появляется в строго отведенных местах, делает строго отведенные действия и исчезает на внушительный период времени. в добавок он настолько заскриптован, что его можно унижать ножом в дверных проемах. В целом за 5 часов игрового процесса на хардкоре, мне постоянно казалось, что я играю в какой-то dead space, а не резидент ивл. Хорошо! предположим вы захотели сделать экшен боевик из хорор игры и вроде как получилось неплохо, но базовая механика осталась от хорора. capcom взяла базу от прекрасного хорора и превратила ее в дерьмовый боевик, который заканчивается через 5 часов после начала. игра не стоит 2000 рублей, и capcom попыталась оправдать стоимость мультиплеером который НАФИГ НИКОМУ НЕ НУЖЕН. следующую часть резика я не куплю в знак протеста и буду до талого ждать таблетки на всем известных ресурсах, ибо я выкинул 2000 рублей на ветер.",Negative
1198,resident-evil-3,convertx1,"Apr  6, 2020",1,"O jogo com certeza foi o meu maior desapontamento do ano. Como fã do RE3, é visível que a qualidade do jogo em relação ao antigo é questionável. Por ser um remake, muitas coisas importantes para a história foram removidas e alteradas. Esse tipo de coisa não pode acontecer. Deve-se manter coisas do original (história, personagens, modo de morrer, sequência de acontecimentos) e se quiser adicionar algo nesse meio, pode ser feito. Vide o RE Remake. Foi uma cópia fiél do original e acrescentando coisas (Lisa Trevor, cenários novos). Isso foi excelente, diferente desse remake. Da maneira que foi feita, além de mudar completamente a imersão, fazem que certos personagens se tornem horríveis. (Brad morreu por um zumbi? O antigo ele morria pelo Nemesis, e era a cena mais marcante do jogo, pois ali vc via o Nemesis pela primeira vez. Como assim não vamos na delegacia com a Jill? Ali é um ponto marcante do jogo. Não temos a torre do relógio, fator importante na história, onde a Jill é infectada). O Nemesis é um ponto negativo. Não se tem mais aquele angustia em cada encontro. Aprendendo a pegar o tempo da esquiva, vc se torna invencível. Além do visual horrível, o Nemeis tem menos formas e a forma horrível dele cachorro, que anda pelos telhados. Isso aqui é RE3 ou RE6? Abaixo os conteúdos cortados em relação ao original:- Modo mercenários;- Escolhas que tinha no jogo original;- Tiraram 90% dos puzzles;- Não tem a Clocktower;- Não tem o PressOffice;- Não tem o Raccoon Park;- Não tem o Cemitério;- Não tem o Boss Gravedigger;- Não tem as Aranhas;- Não tem os Corvos;- Não tem o Stagla (como no original);- Não tem INK RIBBON nem nos modos mais difíceis;- Não tem mais Múltiplos finais",Negative

1200,resident-evil-3,poparoach,"Apr  6, 2020",0,"Никогда не писал отзывов на метакритике. Но для этого высера сделаю исключение. Разработчики плюнули мне в лицо, я плюну в ответ.Игру я так и не прошёл. Моя голова уже начала болеть от того количества фейспалмов, которые я себе отбивал время от времени из-за тупости и кривизны происходящего на экране. Честно говорю, что я читал плохие обзоры на игру ещё до её выхода и уже тогда смекнул, что наверное не стоит заморачиваться на мнении масс и дать игре шанс, потому что от сего ремейка уж точно будет чему улыбнуться давнему хардкорному фанату RE. Я никогда в жизни так не ошибался...Начнём с редизайна персонажей.Джилл. Нет, сама по себе она прекрасна. Её внешность и голос близки к идеалу того, чего я ожидал.НО. При предзаказе нас всех жёстко на е бали, выдав всем ""классический костюм"" Джилл с юбкой и топом. Радости не было предела, потому что её новая одежда реально ударила по канону. Юбкой и топом. Или нет? Ну конечно нет. Юбка была заменена неким подобием шорт. ШОРТЫ,КАРЛ. В чём была проблема разрабов сделать классическую юбку Джилл? Я до сих пор не вкуриваю прикола. То ли это фемки реально начали давить на ""уязвимость"", то ли разрабы поехали крышей на ""реализме"",типа:""ну неудобно же бегать в зомби апокалипсис в юбке"".Кек, а поднимать 150кг лазерную пушку при весе тела в 55-60кг - удобно?Что за абсурд?.(Да и вообще о каком нахрен реализме может идти речь в игре по RE?ЭТО ЖЕ ИГРА ПРО ЗОМБИ,ВАШУ МАТЬ).Поехали дальше. Немесис.. Ну просто шикарный. Неутомимый. Зловещий. Устрашающий. (Это всё сарказм,он просто жалок по сравнению со старичком Немесис из оригинала). Ничего не буду про него говорить, о нём уже давно всё сказано.Следующий пункт, от которого у меня бомбит - разрабы хотели раскрыть второстепенных персонажей больше. Когда я это узнал, я визжал от радости,надеясь на более глубокую историю Михаила, или похождения гниды Николая. Но уж никак я не ожидал то,что под второстепенными персонажами они имели в виду никому не упёршегося н игера, который в оригинале имел роль куска мяса,который должен был себя подорвать гранатой. Так вот, ему выделили в игре больше хронометража,чем тому же Михаилу, или же Николаю.О самом сюжете в целом. Вырезано более 70% оригинальной игры. Что же вырезано?Вырезана Часовня.Вырезан гигантский червь.Вырезан парк города.Вырезано кладбище.Вырезаны пауки.Вырезаны некоторые враги(типа мелких миног-червей).Вырезан момент,где Джилл посещает полицейский участок(где смысл этого - не понятно)Немесис больше не убивает Брэда.(Т.е смысл ""убийцы"" отряда S.T.A.R.S просто теряется)Так слить игру надо уметь.

What's there is good. What's missing is egregious. No clock tower exploration, no gas station, no decisions, no additional information about Nemesis, no Grave Digger, no puzzles, about two cerberus dogs, no crows, no spiders, no real character development, no learning more about Umbrella or the mansion incident/Wesker, removed Nemesis vs Brad scene, pointless tasks to complete, and a good five minute section of what is essentially tower defense in the hospital. Lastly, I took my sweet time in this game. Searching for every item, reading every document, getting as many screenshots of good looking parts of the game and I still beat this thing in under 5 hours. RE Resistance is a total joke of an add on, I don't know what is wrong with Capcom trying to push this sort of garbage on their audience that clearly is unwanted. I got this game for about $45 but still feel kind of ripped off.  I'm having flashbacks to where Capcom pushed out 5, 6, and ORC. Worried about RE8. I highly doubt RE3 will get additional story DLC (even though it desperately needs it), so as it stands, i do NOT recommend purchasing this for any more than maybe $15.",Negative

The game is actually short, but the original 3 part was not long and it could also be run for 3 hours. Compared with the remake of the second chat, the game turned out to be more energetic, and the action of this part was moved from the site to the city (well, at least in 1 half of the game) and the knowledge almost at the very beginning of the game when Jill goes out on the streets of the city creates such a wow effect, the locations have become more open, and personally I like it. People actively hate game, not all of course, I'm also a fan of this series and what happens is the etching of the game by stupid **** who are not able to perceive the new and look at things with a clean look without comparing them with something else These stupid **** do not understand that if you mix with **** this game and if there are low sales then capcom can stop making remakes, despite the fact that in THE re/BIOHAZARD series there are many more games that not everyone knows about, the same RE code veronica(a remake of which I waiting) .

On this alone I would give the game the lowest score. But then we also have the cut content (locations, enemies, mechanics, gamemodes...), abusive price tag, tons of reused assets, lack of replayability, forced multiplayer game, etc. Capcom Ethics Department wins again, and they are more concerned with not offending a minority of SJW who won't even buy the game instead of respecting their fans.

1208,resident-evil-3,Dante_Williams,"Apr  6, 2020",7,"A decent remake although very flawed.  Game looks great and its impressive to see old areas from the original redone in the new engine. The game controls very similar to RE2 Remake but feels a bit more action oriented which may bug people as RE2 remake and Resident Evil 7 where returns to survival horror where resources had to be managed.  In this game I always had more ammo than was needed and could kill every enemy I encountered. The game is also very short and linear, there aren't really any open areas to explore and backtrack through like in previous games, I beat the game on Standard difficulty in 3 hours with 0 deaths and I’m pretty sure with the knowledge I now have from beating it I could skip a lot of looting and beat the game at 1 hour 30 minutes. Nemesis is very scary after you encounter him the first few times, worse than Tyrant.  However, this does not last very long as encounters with him in the zones are very short and only about 3 times total.  The action scenes are also becoming borderline cartoon like with rockets being fired at your feet and only getting pushed out of the way. I hope this isnt a trend we are about to see where the games go back to being action filled as that is what led us to RE6 a few years back. I would not say this game is bad despite my criticisms, I just feel it’s not as good as the previous remake and sure as hell does not deserve the high price tag for what we get.  I got 22% off the game which might be why I’m not as angry as others but you should definitely get the game on sale and avoid buyer’s remorse.",Average
1209,resident-evil-3,Cruciforme,"Apr  6, 2020",3,"First of all, I would like to talk about the main frustration of the game: Nemesis. He is no longer the relentless Nemesis that haunts you all the time. This only happens at a single point in the game. And it is not the same sensation because he jumps like the Hulk and just appears in front of Jill. It is not a shark that slowly approaches its food. They should have taken advantage of that element that was already present in 2 Remake.Anyway, Nemesis is just an excuse for action scenes. You just need to press forward and sometimes use the dodge than you will never die. He's MUCH inferior to Mr. X. And, unlike Mr. X, Nemesis IS the heart of Resident Evil 3.It does not stop there. In addition to taking the heart of the Resident Evil 3 Original, they also cut landscapes, scenery and especially all the puzzles in the original game.For all this, it is a game that is only worth buying when you have a discount and a nice discount.

You can just easily avoid him the few times that you meet him when he roams Racoon City ""looking for you"". Tyran was way more frightening, and smarter.- Doesn't feel like a remake but more like a new version of the 3.- Campaign too short. It could have been a 35$ DLC of RE2 remake.- Atmosphere isn't frightening at all.- Everything is scripted. Spoiler : At the beginning of the game some zombies are blocked behind some fences near the burning street. If I kill them while they're behind, once the fence drops they'll magicaly revive- No bonus modes or a second campaign.

It's short, sweet and doesn't outstay it's welcome. It seems like Capcom decided to remove a chunk of the puzzle solving aspect and just focus on action this time around, which isn't too far removed from form the original RE3 when you think about it. The original was lacking in puzzles in comparison to RE and RE2, so it makes sense this time round as well. It makes for a very streamlined action heavy experience, but it's really quite enjoyable. Nemesis is also a far superior antagonist than RE2's Mr X, actually putting the player in some precarious situations. He's not some slow, lumbering entity that acts as more of a nuisance than any actual threat. It might be a little short for a lot of people(all of the original RE games were short too), especially with that high price tag, but there is more than enough reasons to play through it more than once.

Yet again, resident evil 3 is not a bad game, don't take me wrong, just incomplete, so that's why score a 4, because i feel like its just 40% of the game they've thought of, not even the achievements feel complete, they just skipped a lot of things, the multiplayer? a joke, they recycle a bit of the maps of the multiplayer, It feels rushed from everywhere. If you want to play it, great, but it just feels like a joke. Like an epic action joke. I hope they fix one, because it really felt empty.",Negative
1235,resident-evil-3,mjolnircj117,"Apr  4, 2020",5,"- Missing half the areas of the original game. Instead they are replaced with reused assets and areas from RE2 Remake. Linear areas, little exploration. No puzzles or secrets to speak of. - Nemesis is almost entirely limited to scripted sequences and a few lame boss fights. The only area where he actively stalks you is the one seen in the demo, and its the first area of the game. It's over within the first 40 minutes of gameplay. - Insanely short as others have mentioned. Huge letdown for me, as a fan of the original RE3. For $60, this is a cash grab, and a huge waste of potential. If it weren't too late, I'd vote with my wallet and get a refund on Steam, but I can't. I bought this day 1, avoiding reviews because I trusted Capcom after RE2 Remake and the excellent RE3 demo. Little did I know that the demo contained the best part of the game.

Some negative reviews are saying that the game feels like unfinished, others say it's too expensive etc. You guys need to take a look at things closer (to a things you don't even regularly notice). Just look at the graphics, the music, the feelings you experience during the gameplay. The plot doesn't tear you away, you're in the game, you feel it. Not gonna lie, RE2 remake was better-made, but I still like playing the new one. So the point is, just imagine how much work you gotta put on that one to make everything do it's own job perfectly. That works fine together, and as for me, I had a really good time playing that.I've got no idea how you guys are making it to the end that fast, because 12 hours on the record and I'm still not done with the game (even these 12 hours is enough for me, lol (I know, maybe you just don't like to explore every corner and trying to rush it for some reason, but guys, it's all about the process and the experience you get, that is interesting as hell, besides it makes the game last longer and it is NOT BORING at all)).Of course, if you've played the old version, you may be surprised of not having all the content in the remake, but, it does not make the game worse or not finished in my opinion.If you're new to RE or you've played RE2 remake, just go for it, you'll like it.And if you're a fan of a RE series, and you expect it to be exactly the same as the 1999's version, then it is up to you whether to buy it or not.

1240,resident-evil-3,darklordfoamy,"Apr  4, 2020",6,"Resident Evil 3 remake... okay is there some rule that says the 2nd half of RE3 games has to be mediocre because this seems to be a thing in both this one and the original. So I have mixed feelings on this game. The first couple of hours is exactly what I wanted walking around Raccoon city,  solving puzzles and when Nemesis shows up and start chasing you it's intense... then I threw a grenade at him... on hard mode... it downed him... what. Now granted it was only for a few seconds but well... he continued to be easy to down. Now granted he does learn to protect his big glowy ""SHOOT ME"" part with a hand but that slows him down so he is easy to run from then. Okay I thought first encounter maybe future ones will be... *Capcom employee comes over and whispers something into my ear* what do you mean that is the only time this happens? It happens like 7 times in the original. *Capcom employee whispers again* What do you mean he is now just going to chase me down some corridors and have 4 boss fights from now on? Alright fine so yeah Nemesis is not Nemesis okay but... okay where have the clock tower, park and factory zones gone? *Employee looks around and shrugs but points to the new Lab they added* sooo you took out the unique areas thus taking a good hour or two of game-play out and replaced them with a generic lab? *Employee nods* wow I mean the 2nd half of the original was mmmm but at least those areas were different this is just your generic RE lab... wait what about Gravedigger if the park is missing then wh.... you cut him didn't you? ""... employee nods"" Anything else? ""... employee points out the hunter beta, gamma and drain deimos only show up in 1 area in the game each bar the beta who shows up once more later."" ... Okay so let me guess random enemy spawns are gone to? ""Employee nods?"" Multi choice stuff to? ""Employee nods"" Mercenary mode? ""Shows RE Resistance"" Okay that one I knew about beforehand but at least it is still survival horror and you haven't got a part where I have to fight a army of zombies to defend a specific point with an assault rifle or something right *... points to Carlos who waves* ... oh lord. Yeah so... I am going to say this. You want to play Resident Evil 3 remake and enjoy it... play the demo. That is the best bit of the game and I still enjoy that part even on repeat play throughs. However after that part the game rapidly goes down hill. Do I like what they did with some of the enemies? Yeah I do the new Gammas look freaky and are cool, same with the Betas... the Drain Deimos mmmm not really but yeah the hunters are cool and the zombies are still threatening and Nemesis when he chases you as well but they only show up like this once or twice and then gone. Walking around the city at the start is great but that's it do it once and then gone. Would have been cool to do it at the start and then come back say a day later and see how far it has fallen apart after a day of infection or something as you do have to go back there in the original but not here. Honestly it is clear to me this was done alongside RE2 remake by another team as it has some of the stuff that made RE2 remake great and even the original RE3 great but it's missing so much other stuff that it just feels generic. Overall it is fully playable with no bugs that I saw just missing the bits it needed to make me say go and get it... which is sad because after RE2 remake it could clearly happen just hasn't.

Like I said, they were flaws, but for me they weren't a very big deal anyway and the game was great and most faithful as possible. I said I was hoping for a even more faithful approach in next remakes and here we are. I'm sorry, Capcom, but this time it's a big no from me. I'm so sad to write a negative review, but it's necessary due to this game. This time the situation is really messed up. The game it's kinda fun at the start, but starts to get tedious with time and as a remake it fails terribly. They did it way worse than RE2 Remake in therms of faithfullness. I mean, additions are always welcome, but removal of things? Removal of scenarios? Enemies? And that made the game even shorter. After years dreaming and waiting for a RE3 Remake, we get... this mess.

Learn how to do it with Resident Evil 1 Remake that featured EVERYTHING THE ORIGINAL HAD with additions! (Also, the RE1 Remake new version is so, so way better that is the version that is now actually considered canon). Another great example is Final Fantasy VII that's standing faithful to the original as most as possible. Like I said, I waited YEARS for this remake and it's a deception. What a nightmare. Oh well... This is enough. Stop making these ""remakes"". If the intention is to remove various elements the original had and change it too much, just leave them alone. Don't think about touching Code Veronica or any other. Don't waste your and our times unless you decide to make a faithful remake just like how brilliant RE1R was.

1253,resident-evil-3,TheNerdClub,"Apr  4, 2020",6,"Good Morning, Good Afternoon and Good evening. Welcome to The Nerd Clubs' first review, Resident Evil 3 Remake. Coming into Resident Evil 3 my expectations were high as a big fan of resident evil and Capcom's previous game being resident evil 2 remake which has critical success. The question is were my expectations met or did they end up going down the raccoon city drain, lets find out. Gameplay First up is the gameplay, shooting still feels great as its predecessor shooting system is the exact same over the shoulder style, although it has a lot more action to it, there are still times when I had to limit my ammo and be smart with gunpowder which is keeping it faithful to the original RE3 which was more action-heavy than its predecessor also. One game-changing mechanic is the dodge button, if you successfully time a dodge you are rewarded with max paynesque time slow which will allow you to punish your enemy for trying to chomp on you! Admittedly i found myself spamming the button a few times due to being scared out of mind but I manage to actually use the dodge mechanic correctly and pulled off some amazing dodges which made me feel like a badass, its a great mechanic for casual gamers and speedrunners alike. Nemesis is also a core part of the game, now nemesis does have a few new tricks up his trench coat, he can jump around like crazy in the streets, tentacle pulls you towards your doom and what seems to be an endless amount of rockets and flamethrower fuel, now because the game runtime is quite short it can appear the nemesis does show up often but in fact, I feel like we did not get to see enough of our Tyrant Stalker, we only got experience him once or twice in the streets of raccoon and then following types were an arena type boss battle. The boss battles were fun, we only got to experience one boss but in different multiple forms which for me took away from the game as I wanted to see famous bosses like Grave Digger! I feel like a bit more variety within this particular area would have been great. Puzzles, I love resident evil puzzles as its how you figure out to move onto the next area, you have to earn it but in resident evil 3 there are no puzzles, the closest we get is a train segment finding the clear train to go onto, for me this is a big blow as in the original they were plenty of great puzzles to enjoy. The game seems to be missing a lot of content from the original, which I could usually forgive if they replaced it but they didn't, it kinda ruined the pacing of the game and it felt rushed. Graphics On the PC the game looked great, the characters within the game sometimes looked human in the cutscenes and I would sometimes forget I was playing a game and not watching a tv series. The environments tell a story, if you place close attention to your surroundings you can find hunter marks on the walls with tons of dead bodies, blood trails with dead bodies, teddy bears with wheelchairs in which give the game its mature feel. All of the characters within the game were really well made, I completed the game with the standard models and I have to say they were really well done, something that I picked up on that really impressed me was how dirty jill got, no not like that. As you progress through the game Jill and Carlos both get dirtier, with blood and scratches on their arms, armor and clothes which again done a really good job of immersing me more into the game. Nemesis' new look is great, him slowly mutating as the game continued was interesting and had me wondering how far he could go, the final boss form for me is one my favorite form of bosses I have seen in a resident evil game. The only thing I missed out on was the second form of Nemesis from the original, it seems the developer decided to cut that form out. Graphically the game is pleasing, the lighting has been well done and really adds that extra spooky factor, you can be looking down an alleyway and it will all be dark but at end of the tunnel is a stores neon light, your mind will play tricks walking down the alley, is their zombies or am I missing loot. Everything from a graphics standpoint compliments the gameplay which is a testament to Capcom's great visuals team. Conclusion Resident Evil 3 remake is majorly high quality and is an impressive game but felt really short and lacked allot of content. I personally bought my copy from Gamersgate for £38.99 and if the game did not include the Resident evil resistance I personally would have felt I did not get my money worth, of course, there is replayability by playing in a different costume and doing certain challenges but for the average consumer, I would wait until the game goes on sale. I can't help but feel sad for the game, its missing loads of content from the actual story to no extra content like mercenaries or a different game mode, which every main installment of resident evil has had. Resident Evil 3 a 6.5 out of 10",Average
1254,resident-evil-3,Dynio,"Apr  4, 2020",6,"Hard spoilers ahead. BewareThis is a scandal.There's so much cut content from this game I don't even know where to begin with.We travel almost no Raccoon CIty (where there was plenty of it in original)Until Hospital section It feels like it's not RE game. Almost No backtracking or gathering key items to proceed further, no hard desicions on what to keep in inventory...Check this out. In original You had to collect few items to run the tram (not to mention how far in story it was) ...here ? Your'e in tram in 15-20 min max, and to run it all it takes is to go to two places. No need to gather items.The true RE starts at the hospital section which is great. Finally I had the true RE experience. It was even longer than in original, which is a welcome change. Shame that so much else is cut ! No clocktower, no park. Wtf ?  We even don't get to experience Nemesis as much as we did in original. Sadly what you saw in demo is most of what you'll experience of the ,,classic'' nemesis. Where in original you had plenty of him !Not to mention we had to fight two very much the same fights with him. Almost copy-paste.At the end Jill stands in anime style with huge railgun (really ? Did we need anime-style poses and weapons in RE franchise ? I think not !)This game is a huge slap to the fan's and gamers face.And what do we get for the 60 $ price ? A terribly short experience, Much shorter then original. And Re Resistance. A game no one asked for.I waited 20 years for this game. I could've waited a year more, for a trully well-done product.I wait for a story DLC for BOTH RE 2 and RE 3 remake.please capcom, don't fail us.You did great with hospital, RPD and ,,dead factory'' section.I believe in you. You can still make RE 3 trully marvelous and Give RE 2 the polish it needs (because we all know it's a little bit too short)",Average
1255,resident-evil-3,calibur66,"Apr  4, 2020",7,"TLDR: The game is good, but there are changes and a few things missing, so if you're a die hard fan who's going to lose your **** because you don't like change, then your loss. The game is by no means perfect, but it was always going be to less impressive than RE2 remake because that was the advent of the new engine and world for the RE franchise that people had been asking for for a long time, so RE3 remake was always going to have a less hype reception. My main issues were that I wish it had a few more puzzles as it's a little light on them for sure, as well having atleast one other location that would have been nice for the sake of variety. Also they touch on Jill's PTSD brought on by the events of RE1 but I would have liked perhaps a flashback or something along those lines, at the very least just more instances of the effects it has on her as it's only really factored in once or twice. Some aspects I enjoyed were the fleshing out of the characters and story, particularly Jill and Carlos are much better characters, along with the improved combat. So let's address the main complaints people have below so you can see how ridiculous the Resident evil community can be with their hypocrisy (SPOILERS obviously): Gameplay the same as RE2R: I'm not sure what people were expecting here as the original RE3 in 1999 was released in the same fashion and did the exact same thing the Remake has done, the combat is better but the gameplay style of game is very similar yes. This is the first point that should let you know how wholly unreasonable a large part of the Resident evil community can be because they begged and begged for the game to be as much like the original as possible but then complain about the aspects that are the same. ""Cut content"": In the remake, there is definitely parts of the game that are changed and removed from the original RE3, however whether or not this is good or bad is up for debate as the original was notorious for being the least good of the old style RE games so changes were definitely on the cards and for good reason. The main thing that bothers me about this statement though, is that people love to list off the things that are missing such as the Mercenaries minigame, the multiple endings and the Clocktower/Park locations, however they then don't mention that other parts of the game have been expanded upon and new places added to compensate, which is purely just to be sensationalist and make it seem worse than it is. The Mercenaries game was a very short side game used to unlock extra weapons in the original, where as now you get those extra weapons and costumes from doing specific challenges within the game itself. Mercenaries would have been nice but the fact it's missing is not some catastrophic thing, especially since the game mode was pretty bare bones in the original and wasn't amazing until RE4 used it much later. The Clocktower is still in the game, however it is not a location you actually spend time going through like in the original, while the Park area is completely removed and I will admit I would have liked to have seen it in the new engine, but it was never that important of an area in the original anyway, implemented mainly to facilitate the fight with the Gravedigger boss which again did nothing really for the game as it pops up very short moments for you to kill it and move on, so it's inclusion while nice, wouldn't have elevated the remake to new heights. The Dead factory is NOT gone. Stop lying and saying it is, it's just been changed to look different and be more inline with the remakes art design so the location serves the same function (and provides a better explanation for its existence) as the original while being updated visually for the remake. People also like to say the game has no replay-ability, which shows they simply haven't played it, as there are 2 extra difficulties on top of the usual hardcore. These extra difficulties also change up item and some enemy locations, meaning there is definitely replay-ability, not to mention the shop with all the unlockables you can unlock by completing challenges in game. Even more ridiculous is the comparison between RE2R and RE3R saying that RE2R had so much more content, except it didn't at launch, it had 4th survivor and 3 guns to unlock, the rest of the stuff came later as DLC, so comparing the two at launch is at the very least, dishonest. Nemesis is barely in it: This is flat out lie, I honestly don't know what game people are playing and it definitely makes me think people are simply just spouting lines and opinions from other people instead of playing the game. There is a myriad of things that people will complain about, go play the game yourself to decide, because it's very clear there is just a hearsay crusade for this game that makes zero sense, because a bunch of people would rather just jump on a band wagon than actually form an opinion themselves.",Average
1256,resident-evil-3,Misha_XCX,"Apr  4, 2020",10,"If you are a Resident Evil fan at all this game is worth your time like many others, for a price below 60 it is definitely worth grabbing. The always improving RE engine shines and never fails to impress. The faces, like RE2, look amazing. Scenery is great and gives whole life to the City. Game play is a familiar pick up from people who played RE2, with some nice quality of life changes, like permanent knife and more focus on avoiding combat via dodge mechanic instead of relying on consumables. Nemesis is intense, more so than Mr. X, there isn't a time where it put me on edge. The voice acting is great, very consistent personalities. Jill is still a very independent, bad ass cop, Carlos is still a suave and cocky jar head. Too many people are clouded by nostalgia and yearning for the past experience. RE3 brings a lot to offer to the table that will make you look at the story in a new light and appreciate the direction. Keep in mind the Original Resident Evil 3 had a lot of reused assets and areas because of time constraints and because the original development team was under the impression that the game was going to be a spin off, and not a main title game until 2 months before release. Resistance is a good, but overshadowed by the amazing single player experience for sure.

The game itself can be quite good, but a full-fledged game, like Resident Evil 2 Remake, I can not call it, Resident Evil 3 Remake is more like a good DLC. Without spoilers, I will say briefly about the plot, it is too short and fast, on hardcore I went through the game for 6-7 hours, while I stayed a lot where and explored everything. In Resident Evil 2 Remake, it took me 15 hours to complete the game. All who say that 5-7 hours is the norm, I will say that it is not so, not for this game. 5-7 hours of play is the call of duty level, but not Resident Evil. Separately, I want to highlight Nemesis, it is scarier and more deadly than the tyrant from the second part, but..... all the charm of the gameplay with Nemesis, as with the tyrant, is only at the beginning of the game and then on a small location, all the other meetings with Nemesis either as a boss, or as a scripted s h i t. The tyrant at one time pursued us restlessly for half the game of the second part. The same Nemesis in terms of gameplay merged, do not have time to enjoy running with it, as it turns into scripts. The game does not deserve high marks. Therefore, in a nutshell, my opinion is that Resident Evil 3 is not a separate game, but a good DLC. The price for the game is unjustified.",Negative

1268,resident-evil-3,Mr_Priest,"Apr  4, 2020",3,"Благодаря ремейку 3ей части потерялось понимание зачем было делать эти самые ремейки.(игра пройдена на средней сложности) В этой части почти нет мест по которым можно побродить. Т.е., если во 2ой части у нас был большой полицейский участок, например. И его зоны нам открывались постепенно, то в этой игре в основном много маленьких локаций и нужно дойти из точки А в точку Б и обратно, либо просто из точки А в точку Б. И когда вы это сделаете, то больше вы не увидите этих мест вообще. И гонят вас по ним Немезисом и экшонными катсценами. Т.е., если кто-то хотел таких же ощущений, как от ремейка 2ой части, то вы сильно обломаетесь. Больше зомби, больше патронов, больше медицины. Если в RE 2 Remake большинство встреч с противником напоминало головоломку из которой я мог выйти без стрельбы, то в RE 3 Remake это больше похоже на арену. Я захожу в комнату, на меня вываливают кучу зомби, я их расстреливаю, иду дальше, повторить в следующей комнате или через одну. Сложите это с 1ым обзацем и получите RE 6 Remake, а не RE 3. Ещё 6ую часть напоминает Немезис. Если вы помните сюжетку за Леона и Елену. И помните мутанта, который преследовал их всю игру, то Немезис вам покажется очень знакомым.Добавим к этому его сломанные атаки, когда он может вас схватить или ударить, стоя к вам спиной. Так же геймплейные моменты, когда вам нужно жать одну или целых две кнопки и скучнейшие боссфайты, которые являются таковыми из-за ленивого геймдизайна. У Немезиса паттерн атаки в каждой меняется один раз.По этой причине теряется понимание сколько осталось до конца боя и появляется ощущение его затянутости. Да и чаще всего его появление ничем не обусловлено, кроме задачи сценариста сделать так, чтобы она вас преследовал. И иногда этот выглядит просто потешно. Например, когда из ниоткуда может вылезти его тентакля и схватить Джилл за горло. Добавьте к этому всему вырезанные локации из оригинала, вырезанные сцены из оригинала. Рваное повествование, которые попытались замаскировать под сменой персонажей. Но даже внутри их веток это чувствуется. Ещё в реймейке 2ой части я увидел, что он сделан так, чтобы из всех его составляющий можно было собрать другую игру. И я подумал ""О, как это продумано. Можно не париться и выпустить 3юю часть, как DLC"". И, как бы, так и есть, кроме того момента, что CAPCOM решили скормить этот обрезок, как полноценную игру. Похвалить можно разве что актеров озвучки. Если начать смотреть глазами, а не чем-то ещё, то можно увидеть, что 70% ремейка 3го резидента - это модели, анимация, текстуры ремейка 2ой части. И это логично, что в одном городе так и будет. Но, если игра их реюзает почти полностью, то она точно не стоит 2000 рублей.",Negative
1269,resident-evil-3,NeuroShock,"Apr  4, 2020",4,"Proof that better graphics do not make for a better game... the original was so much better.  Honestly it feels like only half a game.  ONLY BUY THIS GAME ON SALE.  It IS WORTH playing but you are not going to want to replay this one. MY BIGGEST PROBLEM with this remake is that if feels like they took more out of game compared to the original and it feels rushed and empty.  In a remake I feel like they need to add more not take more out. + Nemesis feels more like a treating than ever in terms of strength, and speed.+ The power station bug section is amazing and unique and the game needed a lot more of those sections.+ The dodging mechanic is back and it feels good when you get it right!  A very good add to this game.+++ The end game timer does not count the cut-scenes & the cinematic moments+/- First of all the game is too short but that has never been a problem for the RE series BUT it is here because there are no puzzles, and linear game play.+ Changing Jill's design makes more sense because the original tube top and mini shirt just don't make sense.---NO RE-PLAYABILITY (harder modes do not count)-The puzzles are too easy to the point where it is embarrassing.-This game sacrificed having a big city to explore to becoming something that felt empty and horribly linear.  There are too many landmarks in the city missing, No clock tower (mostly), No Raccon Park, No graveyard, No gas station, No newspaper building, No Mayor statues. No construction sites (not really).  The game did not feel like a city if felt like 2 blocks of a town and that is a huge problem.- The story was so poorly written and that pacing felt so rushed that characters never got a chance to have the interactions they needed for the story to feel right.- The original game has these quick time events where you had to make decisions that really effected game play and enhanced re-playability and because that was neglected that game feels linear and empty.- Missing enemies like giant worm, Grave digger and spider- No multiple endings. I just want to be honest this game is NOT a 0 but it is NOT a 10 by any means.",Negative

Don't worry about your ammo, the scripted boss fights showers you with it as if you just chainsaw'd a random demon, DOOM style! Toned down gore, I streamed the whole playthrough and didn't manage to dismember a single zombie.

The Original was also very action focused, but back then ""action"" meant something a little bit diffrent. This game is made with MODERN standards in mind, and while some things were a little bit out of the place, it's perfectly balanced in that regard (in my opinion). A lot of things were cut out in favor of new stuff, which isn't that bad BUT I have to admit, some parts will be greatly missed (tho Capcom at the very least gave a few subtle nods to the OG fans). The biggest issue with RE3R seems to be the game time. If you are some kind of Speedy Gonzales then yes, it can take you only 4 hours to finish the game on your first playthrough, but it was clearly made with the intent to replay it as many time as possible, something that is not very common in games these days. There is a shop for unlockables (I hope they will add more things to it tho) and 2 unlockable difficulties that not only make enemies more tough but also change item placement.

1325,resident-evil-3,ChaseFace,"Apr  3, 2020",6,"As a MASSIVE fan of the original Resident Evil 3, this is a massive letdown in every sense of the word. I liked the RE2 remake. They changed what they needed to change and improved on almost everything aside from the Scenario A/B feature which removed any sense of commitment or punishment. Resident Evil 3 Remake has no impulse control. It doesn't want you to get invested by introducing you to the universe and slowly building up to Nemesis' reveal like it does in the original where you save Brad from a zombie in a bar, he warns you about ""he's coming for us,"" and then gets killed by Nemesis in front of the RPD. In the first 5 minutes of this game, Nemesis breaks into Jill's apartment which prompts a scripted chase sequence. Then you meet Brad who dies immediately in the cliche ""I'm bitten, I'll hold them off, save yourself!"" way that all zombie fans are used to, then you meet Dario Rosso, the man who freaks out on you after losing his daughter, but in the remake he's bald, makes no mention of his daughter, and his voice actor sounds so flat and irritated. That was when I knew this game was going to be bad. Dario isn't an important character, he's literally just a survivor who throws his hands up, locks himself in a storage truck and tells you he's not going anywhere after seeing his daughter get eaten by zombies. It's tragic, and the original voice actor for Dario, Tony Rosato, really gave it his all. Even darker still, Rosato suffered from Capgras syndrome, in which he believed all of his loved ones had been replaced by imposters before dying in 2017. His performance as Dario was phenomenally heart-wrenching and believable. In R3make Dario just scoffs at you and delivers a similar speech of ""I'm not going to sit around and be eaten by undead monsters! Now leave me alone!"" except the new VA managed to make it sound irritated more than emotional. A small part of the game for sure but you'll find that ""rushed with no attention to detail"" will be a theme in this game as you play. For the rest of the game Nemesis occasionally pops up to stalk you, and when he does he lingers for a while. Mr. X in Resident Evil 2 was scary but once you hid in a safe place he would forget about you and wander off. Nemesis in the remake waits for you outside of safe rooms and any other locations he can't get into. He just stands there like a hunter watching his prey. It's terrifying. It's really good. And then the next time you see him it's another scripted action sequence where you lose him and fight sewer monsters. When Nemesis is there, he's terrifyingly aggressive, almost to the point of frustration. When he's not, he's being replaced by less scary bullet sponge monsters that serve to simply eat away at the player's bullets. I was talking to a friend who already beat the game and he said ""Resident Evil 3 feels like a game that's going to have an anxiety attack if it doesn't get to make something explode,"" and I'm inclined to believe him. Capcom, we don't care about RESISTANCE, the little multiplayer game that you tacked on using recycled assets from the RE2 remake. It's shallow, it's repetitive, it's tedious and arcadey. Remaster Resident Evil Outbreak and do it right. That game knew how to do horror multiplayer. Really disappointing game. They could have done better, and they simply chose to cut corners.",Average
1326,resident-evil-village,Young_Fawn,"Jun 21, 2023",8,"A Great Resident Evil Game I bought Resident Evil 8 on release but couldn't quite get into it when it came out. Originally it came out in May and I prefer to play my horror games in the winter so this game took the back burner and I forgot all about it until the Winter's Expansion. Firstly, I played the game fully in Third Person Mode and had a great time with it. So much so I think it's better than the first person mode, it doesn't feel half baked or just a tag-on. It genuinely feels very fresh and similar to the other RE remakes. The story itself is a direct sequel to the events of Resident Evil 7, if you have not played RE7, you shouldn't buy this game until completing it, otherwise you will miss out on a lot of context and nuance the game provides. For me the best part about the game was exploring the village and seeing what goodies you can find here and there. Sometimes it requires you to progress to different parts of the game to get access to certain parts of the village, but I don't mind that kind of back tracking. The way I view the game is as such: The Village is your main hub to explore and the four zones are sort of like ""Dungeons"" to an extent. Very linear for the most part and allow you to progress the story, the only real free-roam you get is within the village and it's not exactly very big to begin with. I think the story is quite well written, it's nothing to write home about in comparison to other games like Detroit: Become Human, or Death Stranding, but it's strong enough to keep you wanting to know what happens next. Exploration is massively rewarded, back tracking in the village after you find certain items is also rewarding. Don't be afraid to go off the obvious path, because there's almost always something there for you to obtain or experience. My only complaint is somewhat similar to the one I had for the Resident Evil 3 remake, and that is that there's sometimes just too much ammo in the game, you can easily fight your way through every enemy and still have enough to spare to continue; it really takes away from that element of survival horror in which ""Should I fight or should I run?"" The boss design is very cool and the set pieces are wonderful to look at and explore. I found that most, if not all, of the characters are interesting and have their own backstories. Overall, Resident Evil Village is a great addition to the series and absolutely worth playing, doubly more if you've played Resident Evil 7. 8/10 - I'll probably do some more playthroughs at some point on higher difficulties.",Positive

Why does this game get so much praise?A riddle much more difficult to answer than every riddle combined, that was presented in Resident Evil Village. Though, that was far from the worst aspect in this game. Puzzles never had a great difficulty in the Resident Evil franchise. They were, and are here, too, mere minigames. This game is absolute mediocrity.Performance issues 1 1/2 years after release.UI/UX that is straight from a nightmare, including settings for resolution that would apply it the moment you change it. So going from the default resolution to my screen resolution took more time than some of the boss fights. Whoever gave this his OK should quit his job.Some areas were an utter catastrophy.The enemies had no weight to them. It felt like Ethan was shooting at cardboard.The enemies lacked variation and multiple hitboxes. Resident Evil 4 and 5 did this marvelously.Enemy variety? There were like 5 types of enemies, not including minibosses (Sisters) or Bosses. There was barely a noticable difference to all of them. Ugh. What a wasted opportunity. They even started with the fantasy realm, vampires and werewolfs.The gunplay was ridiculous. Look what the original Dead Space did, over 10 years (?) ago. And look at this.Also, this game lacks any survival feeling. Especially that last part where one runs with close to infinite ammo through the village just shooting like a maniac... yeah. Zero horror.This isn't a horror game, nor a survival game. It is a pathetic conveyer belt shooter. The best part of this game is the castle, and that by a massive gap to the ""next best"" area. I wonder. I immediately start thinking if this might be on purpose. I mean, the detail and interactions that one encountered during the castle part were certainly well done, not so much for the rest. The castle was also the only playable part pre-release (and the very first few minutes), as well being the only area that was present in trailers in more detail. Must have been a massive money-saver to only focus one the castle for presentation purposes while ignoring the quality for the rest. Good management here, Capcom. Compare this game to true survival horror games, like Evil Within or the already mentioned Dead Space. It's leagues apart. Keep in mind, this is Capcom, which developed a new installment for one of the biggest IPs.It is an insult to gamers, yet they don't seem to care.Oh and of course, the biggest gripe: This game is/was full price, and yet it is only ~7 hours long, WITH exploration. What a joke.I'm glad I paid only 15 bucks for this.",Negative

1379,resident-evil-village,Trunks252,"Mar 16, 2022",7,"I'll be honest and upfront; I'm not thrilled with this new direction. Resident Evil has been such a huge part of my childhood, and still to this day my favorite horror franchise in video games. It is my go-to series for shooting, horror, action, ridiculous situations, and cheesy stories and dialogue. I am overwhelmed with thoughts for the latest game, so here is my review after completing the game recently. Village is at it's absolute best when you are exploring the environment, upgrading your arsenal, and making progress. The atmosphere and exploration are truly excellent. I really enjoyed the setting and environments. Pretty much every map was well designed and visually stunning. It feels like old school resident evil, which I thought was lacking in RE7. The characters in Village are a mixed bag. Duke was surprisingly great, and I'd love to see more of him in the future. Heisenberg was also really interesting, and I really wish he and Ethan could have joined their efforts to fight Miranda. That would have been a nice twist and shaken up what otherwise just felt like more of the same. Miranda's other three children were good enough to keep me interested, and they were exceptionally well acted. Miranda herself fell kind of flat for me. As for Ethan and his family, well...not a fan. In fact, they really got on my nerves in both this game and RE7. Ethan is supposed to be an avatar for the player, but that really does not work for me. It's a trope in video games that needs to go away. On top of that, he is very whiny and talks way too much to be the silent protag type. This conflicting of ideals just does not work for me. I feel like the game was supposed to be more dramatic, sad, empathetic, etc. Like it wants me to take it seriously. That just does not make sense in a ridiculous, totally unrealistic RE game. Resident Evil ""B movie"" narrative is at it's best when the characters are funny and the dialogue overflows with cheese. Leon in RE4 has to be my favorite example of this. He is completely un-phased by the horrific things happening to him. It's like a joke to him. He is completely capable of dealing with any threat, to the point that he just mouths off the dumbest one-liners. And yet, you can tell he cares about people and has some sense of justice. Ethan is like the polar opposite to me, and really sucks the fun out the experience. He's pretty much a downer the entire time. Chris was similarly disappointing. I don't need to explain why. Even his teammates told him how much of a jerk he was. And that brings me to the story. RE has never really been about the story. I don't really have much to say here, except that it's typical crazy RE. Unfortunately the main characters kind of ruined it for me. It was silly and ridiculous, and nonsensical. Which is a good thing. But ultimately didn't really matter because of the characters. I appreciated the inspiration they drew from RE4. They nailed the merchant and exploration. Searching every room for treasure and resources is always a blast. That said, I feel like they missed what really made me want to play RE4 so many times: the guns. RE4 has the best gunplay in the series, and really in any shooter I've played. Each gun had it's own personality, and it's own special name. You can feel every shot. You can immediately feel the upgrades as soon as you fire. You can really feel the impact of your choices in upgrades by the end of the game. Village, on the other hand, doesn't really have any of this. It just feels like generic CoD guns to me. Guns have standard-issue feel; even the names are generic. This, unfortunately, is the best way to describe the gunplay. Generic. By the end of the game, I really felt no difference in my arsenal from when I started. Most shots didn't even phase the enemies, other than lowering their health. Unloading an entire handgun clip into an enemy, only for it to keep moving as if you hadn't even shot it, is not very satisfying. Huge missed opportunity here. Some aspects of the gameplay were really well done. The transitions from horror/action were telegraphed in each section so you knew what to expect. Several boss fights were engaging and well done, like Moreau (fish guy). Miranda was pretty stunning, visually. Each of the vampire sisters was short and sweet, with a cool finale on the rooftops with Lady Dimitrescu. Most of the puzzle solving, while easy, was enjoyable. I especially liked the ball puzzles. Gotta say though, those torch puzzles can go to hell. I adored the section with the slug baby. Just overall fantastic. Even the puzzles leading up to it were engaging and dynamic. Very well done. The doll boss fight was a bit lame, but that section overall was maybe the best part. Honestly this was only a fraction of my thoughts on this game and modern RE, but I have to end somewhere. I will just say, I hope to see more returning characters in the next game. I really don't care about Ethan's family.",Average

1385,resident-evil-village,AngryShark92,"Feb  2, 2022",9,"Bitter-sweet to have experienced Resident Evil Village, for one thing, I think it is an incredible game and is reminder of an era when gaming was fun, but, it is the only release in 2021 that I thoroughly enjoyed, and it is alarming that only one game (outside of Rift Apart, which is not for me) was even worth any gamer's time... RE8 can best be summarized as a modernized version of RE4, the similarities are everywhere (including a few subtle nods to the past), bosses with their own dedicated sections, humble merchants, currency systems, inventory management, unique characters, as well as fun puzzles and secrets to figure out and discover, and I am sure there are even more similarities that I am forgetting as well. Now normally, it would be incredibly easy to criticize a game for copying a previously released title in their catalogue (FIFA & CoD come to mind), but Village does enough to separate itself from its predecessor. Village is the perfect combination of Action & Survival Horror genres, and while I certainly enjoy the two, I do think this game excels more when it is focusing on the latter. The Village, the Castle, and the Beneviento house, are the prime examples of the horror element of the series, while the Moreau reservoir, Stronghold, & the Factory certainly buildup the action side of things. I enjoyed all of the areas, but the Village & the Castle are my favourite areas in the game by far. It seems like more effort and attention were put into those two areas than the other three, and I'm sure that is contributing to people criticizing the game's length. The boss fights leave a bit to be desired, but the bosses themselves (as well as the merchant) are all very well done, from their designs, to the voice acting, the lore behind them all, Village really did a good job crafting their antagonists, something I wish I could say for the protagonists. The setting and atmosphere are also top-notch, it genuinely feels like you are exploring an Eastern European (Romanian?) village setting, but the atmosphere is what really stood out to me, I felt on-edge the whole time on my first play-through, and even on bits of my second, and this is in huge part due to the horror elements of the game being well-implemented. I never felt particularly safe, and while I was anxious about every move of progression, I certainly enjoyed being kept on my toes like I did in RE, RE2, RE3, & RE7. This is when Resident Evil is at its best, when it nails the survival horror atmosphere, and to my mind, there aren't many games that can do it better. Why 9, and not 10? Simple, the story is just not very good, and it really shows in the third act, and without giving too much away, there are a few contrivances and explanations which just seem implausible in a desperate effort to tie RE8 to the rest of the series, and RE7 in particular. Also, the less said about Chris' motives and arc, the better, he feels like he was shoe-horned in for fan service because I barely recognize him as the same character in previous games. This directly ties into my second issue, which is that I don't really feel the same way about Ethan & Mia, as I do about Jill, Claire, Leon, & Chris. There is nothing that I can really relate to or latch onto them with that keeps me emotionally invested, and it is sorely needed for a game that crafted its villains as well as Village (& RE7) does. + Phenomenal balance of survival horror and action+ Well crafted characters (villains & merchant)+ Incredible atmosphere and tension+ Sound effects/soundtracks are terrific+ Setting is incredibly well done+ Combat is satisfying+ Replay-ability+ Game is aesthetically gorgeous+ Exploration and puzzles are fun+ RE4 Inventory management and currency system+ Mercenaries mode returns+ Loads of New Game Plus content - Weak protagonists (Ethan, Mia, & Chris)- Story could be better, weak third act- HDR is way too dark (looks incredible though)- Audio syncing issues during some dialogue sequences- Ray Tracing is barely noticeable Overall, Resident Evil Village is an incredible entry in the series and a must play for RE fans or fans of survival-horror, it is the only game I would recommend from 2021, and I am glad that Resident Evil is still going strong in an industry that is stagnating and being drained of creativity. 9/10.",Positive

1390,resident-evil-village,MaximumD,"Jan  5, 2022",8,"I bought this game on a steam sale and was pretty happy that it exceeded my expectations. I think it's the 3rd best Resident Evil game after RE2 Remake and RE4. I didn't really like 7 that much and since this was a direct sequel I was concerned. However, I have to admit I had a ton of fun playing this game and even beat it on the hardest difficulty. It takes elements from RE7 and RE4 and combines them to great effect. There is a lot of variety to the gameplay but also some weak tedious parts that drag the game down. Gunplay is pretty solid and the variety of weapons is nice. You'll mostly use the shotgun. It's typical RE stuff where you are extremely slow and have to manage by aiming well and controlling the situation. There are a few puzzles here and there but nothing reaching the level of RE past games. Thankfully, these sections do not last long you are soon back to blasting away werewolves and ghouls. I would say the highlight of the game is the infamous vampire lady's castle which is very vintage RE. It's got a little bit of everything. Puzzles, shooting, and exploration/item hunting. At that point you also have very few resources, so it's more in line with early RE games. The story is produced well but it does get a little out of control towards the end as usual. Although Capcom does a nice job of tying in canon from past games. There are some serious inconsistencies here though but you just have to remember this is a RE game so you just have to go with it. I was a little disappointed by the ending too. There also many little scripted sequences involving some of the non boss enemies in the game that add to the excitement and plenty of docs to read that expand on the story. It's worth is to read everything you find as it fleshes out the backstories on the bad guys. Graphically, it's pretty top notch too and the entire game is very immersive. The characters all have great detail and textures really pop. The environments are all well put together and it really pulls you in. I liked this much more than what we got in RE7, especially that terrible ship area. The game is a little bit on the short side but you can play through various times with some bonus weapons and even unlock infinite ammo to just have some fun. Also, Mercenaries mode returns for that replayability factor. In the end, I was pretty satisfied with this outing in the RE universe. It advances the series main story and ties up some loose ends. The action is solid but slow, like in RE4. You can almost say this like a remake of RE4, cuz the similarities are very many. You even have the mysterious merchant show up. Pleasantly surprised and looks like Capcom has this series back on track for the most part except for the terrible RE3 remake :( A solid 8 i think since there were some areas of the game that are pretty tedious and the story is a little loose here and there. Overall great though.",Positive

Its not that RE: Village is a bad game why I'm giving it a low rating, quite the contrary as the game itself is pretty good, the reason I'm giving it a low rating is because the game should not be called Resident Evil but be a seperate franchise of its very own with its own name, you can't help but hate Ethan (who you play as) as well, let's hope this is the last we see of this blank uninteresting slate of a character.

Hikayeden bahsedeyim biraz. Gözlerden uzak bir köye yerleşen Ethan ve Mia çifti, geçmişte yaşadıklarından sonra yeni doğan kızları Rose ile sakin bir hayat sürmektedir. Ethan, daha önceden yaşananları yok sayarak yaşamına devam etse de Mia eski konuları sürekli açmakta ve ikili bu yüzden sıklıkla tartışmaktadır. Bir akşam beklenmedik bir şekilde çiftin evlerine baskın düzenlenir ve istihbarat görevlileri eve girer. Baskını düzenleyen ekibin komutanı Chris Redfield'tır. Chris, ekiple birlikte evi bastıktan sonra Ethan'ın gözü önünde Mia'yı öldürür ve Rose'u da alarak evden ayrılır. Yaşananları anlamlandıramayan Ethan şok geçirir, daha sonra ekipteki askerlerden biri Ethan'ı bayıltır. Ethan ayıldığında kendini bir araç enkazının içinde bulur, yanındaki asker de ölmüştür. Etrafı araştırmaya ve nerede olduğunu anlamaya çalışan Ethan, çok geçmeden ıssız bir kasaba yakınlarında bulunduğunun farkına varır. Ethan kasabaya doğru ilerler ve oradan kurtulmanın, kızını bulmanın yollarını aramaya başlar. Bir süre sonra Ethan bu kasabada ters giden bir şeylerin olduğunu anlar. Etraf çok sessizdir ve kasaba terk edilmiştir, ayrıca kasabada işlerin yolunda gitmediği de çok rahat bir şekilde anlaşılmaktadır. Olaylar bu köyde şekillenir ve Ethan kızını aramaya devam eder. Çok geçmeden Ethan, Duke'ten edindiği bilgiler ışığında kızının dört farklı kavanoza yerleştirildiğini öğrenir. Bu kavanozlar Miranda Ana'nın geriye kalan çocuklarında her birinde birer tane olacak şekilde bulunmaktadır. Ethan, Dimitrescu'yu öldürdüğünde ilk kavanozu bulmuştur. Ethan'ın Miranda Ana'nın çocuklarının bölgesine gidip kavanozları hepsinden alması gerekmektedir. Ethan bunu yapar ve Miranda Ana'nın 4 çocuğunu da saf dışı bıraktıktan sonra kavanozların hepsini ele geçirir. Sıra Miranda Ana'ya gelir, ancak Miranda Ana, Ethan'ı öldürür. Ethan öldürüldükten sonra garip bir yerde Eveline'i görür ve Eveline, Ethan'a onun aslında Bakerların evindeyken öldüğünü söyler. Söyleneni kabul etmeyen Ethan ailesini kurtarması gerektiğini söyleyerek uyanır. Miranda Ana, Rose ile yapacağı ayini tam başlatacağı sırada yetişir. Miranda Ana ile savaşan Ethan, onu öldürür ve Rose'u ondan alarak uzaklaşmaya başlar. Daha sonra Chris ile karşılaşan Ethan, başaramayacağını anlayınca Rose'u ona verir ve onu kurtarmasını söyler. Ardından Chris'ten Megamycete'e yerleştirilen bombanın kumandasını alarak Chris ile Rose gittikten sonra bombayı patlatır ve kendini feda eder. Hikayenin sonunda büyüdüğü görülen Rose, babasının mezarını ziyaret eder; ardından kendisi için getirilen arabaya binerek uzaklaşır. Hikaye bu şekilde sona erer. Ben genel olarak hikayeyi ortalama düzeyde buldum. Karakterler konusunda hikayenin zayıf olduğunu söyleyebilirim. Chris, Miranda Ana, Dimitescu ve Heisenberg karakterleri aslında ilgi çekici bir konsepte sahipler, ancak oyunun bu karakterleri işleyecek zamanı olmadığı için maalesef hikayede hak ettikleri kadar yer edemiyorlar. Özellikle oyunun tanıtım fragmanlarından sonra büyük göğüsleri sebebiyle fenomen haline gelen ve sayısız internet şakasına konu olan Dimitrescu'nun hikayede çok az yer etmesi çoğu oyuncu için hayal kırıklığı oldu. Aynı şekilde Heisenberg ve Miranda Ana da daha iyi işlenebilirdi fakat oyunun kısıtlı süresi maalesef buna izin vermemiş. Hikaye sunumu olarak oyunu serinin önceki oyununa göre biraz daha zayıf buldum fakat yine de sunum zayıf değil. Oynanış tarafı beni fazlasıyla memnun etti. Hatta beni bu oyuna bağlayan tarafın oynanış ve atmosfer olduğunu rahatlıkla söyleyebilirim. Kullanılan oyun motoru oldukça iyi. Ara sahnelerde ve oynanışta karakter animasyonlarının, düşmanların aldığı hasara karşı verdikleri tepkilerin güzel olduğu rahatlıkla söylenebilir. Vuruş hissi konusunda da oyun oldukça tatmin edici, düşmanlar vuruldukları bölgeye göre farklı tepkiler veriyor ve güçlü bir silahla düşmanı kafadan vurmanın verdiği hissiyatın bu oyunda çok iyi olduğu su götürmez bir gerçek. Düşman çeşitliliği yeterli düzeyde olmasa da silah çeşitliliği iyi ve bölüm sonu canavarları genellikle keyifli. Grafiksel olarak da oyun başarılı. Aynı şekilde optimizasyon da iyi, performans gayet stabil. Oyunu oynarken herhangi bir hataya rastlamadım. Resident Evil Village çok derin ve detaylı bir hikayeye sahip olmasa da oynanış ve atmosferi ile beni memnun etti. Bunları fena olmayan bölüm sonu canavarları ve güzel tasarlanmış bölüm dizaynları ile taçlandıran Resident Evil Village kesinlikle önceki oyuna yaraşır bir devam oyunu.",Positive

1419,resident-evil-village,SilverOrlov,"Sep 24, 2021",8,"I want to note firstly that I mostly liked the game, so the rating is not low. But a certain list of negative points left their mark. Therefore, this rating is ""minimally green"".So what I liked here: Very good graphics. At almost the highest settings, there were no problems at all with stability. Well-chosen music and very well-done sounds. Good elaboration of faces and facial expressions of characters. I can't say it's perfect, but still it is a very good work... The game, in general, has an interesting story. Not a masterpiece, but for this series of games it is on a quite good level... Skillful dilution of the gameplay between action and horror(though not scary). Except the plant, the rest of the locations seemed interesting and goodly to me. The village was authentic :)...And now what I didn't like here:(((Strongly))) Throughout the game, one thought did not leave my mind, ""Just shut up your boorish mouth""... The developers have completely turned this moment upside down: On the one hand, the protagonist went through a real Hell in Louisiana and did not become a commando, but learned to survive and fight. And here he constantly giving out something like “I don’t understand”, “What is it?”, “It cannot be,” is lost on an ordinary illusion, because if you are not an idiot, you will elementarily understand that there is an illusion in front of you. Yes, the monsters in different closets may differ, but here the authors deliberately sucked emotions out of their fingers and made drama for the sake of drama. On the other hand, he should have understood the danger of monsters, but at the same time he is rude, swears, haughtily insults bosses, monsters, places in that Village. It is as if he was one of the bosses of this World. It just pisses me off. And the most idiotic of these moments for me was when he was given 10 seconds to run away from the chase, and he started when there was ONE SECOND LEFT! ...Some large monsters ignore the tactics necessary for them(a large werewolf flies back after a shotgun in a face during his swing/flight, but this only works in 50%.(((Average))) That wildly incomprehensible nonsense that you meet at the very beginning of the game (in the house, in the prologue) is then explained almost at the end. But the idiocy of the act itself does not justify this. Moreover, one of the soldiers is also talking about it on the walkie-talkie... Too much archaism, which in 2021 should already be wildly embarrassing to use. Even if once it was in all the old games: a key hanging in the air, you cannot climb three steps in a room, or go around the lawn because of the hard ""invisible walls"", the disappearance of the corpse of an ordinary human with his gun and bullets on the field with a scarecrow. It doesn't brake game-play, but already annoying a lot.(((Minor))) Inconvenient control of the inventory. These manipulations with the shift and mouse buttons - you get used to it later, but it looks stupid ... Some inadequate prices from the merchant. Not in terms of the prices themselves, but in terms of ""a loaf of bread for a million shells"", if you understand what I mean ...One of the soldiers at the end says that ""5 bullets to the head means a lot"", and this is ridiculous after the fact that in the game itself the weakest monster is killed with 4-5 hits to the head.((())) This is not a criticism or a drawback for me, that's why this will be separate: the bosses were interesting, but I would like some more thoughtful design of such unique characters. All except the fish died at the first try. Even mini-bosses. The fish killed me the first time almost by accident. And I'm not the hard-player. This is bad... But I liked the fact that they are all, in fact, different. Really different....Although all these annoying things did not ruin the games, I really can't give it a high rating. On the other hand, I do not just recommend it, but highly recommend it. This is the case when not ""try it, maybe you will like it"", but when ""be sure to play it, there will be a few stupid decisions, but it's worth it.""",Positive
1420,resident-evil-village,kingofkoopas,"Sep 21, 2021",1,"For the most part 'Resident Evil Village' never rises above mediocrity. Banal is the word I would use to describe the whole game. Hardly any thought went into this. Most of the game's money was thrown into graphics and it shows. The game looks stunning, Resident Evil has never looked better. That's the best thing I can say about this game. Yes there are some great moments sprinkled sparsely throughout Ethan's journey. Add all of those moments up and you might make an hour's worth of genuine fun. The thing that makes this game sink into the abyss is the developers contempt for their audience and their greed for money. The game is mind-numbingly dull. There are only a few moments where the game requires you to think on your feet. The first one being the tedious intro where you have to survive the onslaught of lycans in hopes of triggering the cut-scene that puts and end to it. The last boss is well done, it does provide a good challenge. The boss fight with the giant lycan that swings the hammer is also a bit fun. An honorable mention is the toad boss, for me it was a little difficult mostly because he is a bullet sponge. That's about where the fun starts and ends, with those boss fights. There is a boss fight in the game(if you can call it that) that requires you to walk around a small house and QTE the boss using only one button! They didn't even bother making it a QTE where you have to do a series of inputs, nope, just press one button and done. And that so called ""boss"" is the best part of that section of the game. You reach a house and upon going in you lose your weapons. It's time to play walking simulator for an hour plus. Really CAPCOM? Am I supposed to be scared or engaged knowing that until you give me back my weapons nothing in the game is going to kill me? How can that possibly create immersion? Oh right, because gamers think immersion equals gorgeous graphics. People are so gullible nowadays, look at the positive reviews. Pay attention when they talk about the haunted house part. These people can no longer think properly or think for themselves. After bumbling around for an hour examining things with absolutely no enemies, let alone being able to die you are chased by a giant baby caterpillar! At a snail's pace the caterpillar follows you around for a few lapses. It's not scary, it's not difficult, it's just boring. The game is one massive scripted event with hardly any freedom. Once in a while the game lets you off its chains and gives you some time to explore at your leisure. Not that there is a whole lot to explore but there is some. And when you can, it feels nice those are the few times where the game creates immersion. It's as Shigeru Miyamoto once said. ""When I create games I make the player sit in the director's chair. It's his game and he decides how he wants to do things."" Resident Evil Village suffers from the Western ""bro"" mentality that has been plaguing gaming for over a decade. Where immersive games are pseudo interactive movies that mostly play themselves. Village is just that, an interactive movie with the most mundane gameplay offered by AAA gaming. A mash up of everything that is popular to appeal to every brain dead consumer. Even R.L Stine's Goosebumps series offers more horror and entertainment than this attempt at Resident Evil.",Negative

1423,resident-evil-village,ZeroMajor,"Sep  2, 2021",8,"Resident Evil Village is a good game. The bosses, level design, and characters surely take the bread out of this one. What makes this game worthwhile are the unlockables, further bolstering its replayability and rewarding players to keep playing more. The level design is done well where players can find items easier than the previous installment, characters are written well enough for an enjoyable experience, immersing you into the world of what Resident Evil wants to show you. It's done similar to Resident Evil 4, a mysterious virus outbreak in a religious village, castles and technology everywhere, and the raid on the player. The graphics are impressive and the cutscenes can now be skipped, allowing players to come back for more action. But that's where the problem stems. Unlike Resident Evil 7, the characters introduced are more laid back, energetic, and just them showing off. While RE 7 had a cast that was able to induce a haunting aura to the player, creating tension and fear in them, which is what a horror game should do. This could lead to fans feel less immersed and don't get to have fun in a game that they adored dearly. Next, Village's enemies are more of a pushover than 7. In every scenario the player is pushed into, only the Lycans posed such a threat to the player in all stages of the game. Killing enemies in the castle, and the factory feels more of a chore than a real challenge. They don't feel dangerous, rather annoying to be dealt with in the first place. Which can lead to experiencing boredom. No matter what difficulty you set in the game, the enemies are too weak to be dealt with. Other than that, the early game weapons don't scale very well, often having other weapons taking the spotlight and only makes them obsolete. Even at their strongest, the weapons simply don't stand any chance against the big guns. The weapons lack some sort of advantage that can still make them valuable against the hands of some powerful weapons. Because of that, the number of weapons considered useful is limited and causes the player to imply the same tactic by the end of the day. Lastly, the difficulty of the game is bad, having only artificial values going up to satisfy the player, which for me isn't worth it. The higher it goes, the more necessary you need powerful weapons to push through the game, which is more tiring than enjoyable. Not only that, it becomes a necessity to upgrade your stats to simply live through the hardest difficulty, causing the game to be severely flawed in terms of difficulty. In conclusion, it's still a good game, but not a fun one. Because of its overreliance on stat upgrades, treasure collecting, and limited options for weapons, the game can only hope for the unlockables and the story to do well enough for the flaws to be overseen. In the end, I don't think it's that bad, but this flaw is what hinders me from considering this a masterpiece.",Positive

Lady Bonnaviento is the one I found the most frightening, and not unlike an episode of Saw, although her chapter is not long. As for Mordeau, I think he was more of a filler antogonist and Miranda was sorely lacking for the final boss of a game like this. I personally think they should have kept Heiselberg's father as the final boss. There's also the Duke who made interesting references to the merchant in RE4.

1437,resident-evil-village,AllNewSuperfake,"Jul 28, 2021",4,"Resident Evil ist a weird series for me. I've played every main entry, but I've never finished one of them. Most of the time I only played them for a few hours, and than they rotted away on my harddrive just to be deinstalled. It is weird because I never thought of them as bad. Or boring. I found each one scary. I was always satisfied with the presentation. I loved the enemy design. The scenarios were interesting. The underlying mystery was enduring. And yet, to my shame, it's RE 6 that I played the longest, for a simple reason: It was the best port, even though everything else about it was decent at best. And here is another game with all the aforementioned qualities, missing one thing: A decent port. An optimized experience. A mouse that works flawlessly and keyboard controls that make you feel in control. ""Village"" is a chore to play, with hickups, stuttering, lagging audio, slowdowns and a framerate that goes from 60 to slide show in an instant for no discernible reason. Resident Evil 8 also commits the general sin of bad direction, taking control away from you whenever something interesting happens and suddenly giving it back to you, with questionable results for the flow and atmosphere. I watch myself doing incredible badass stuff in cutscenes and go back to lying helplessly on my back seconds later. I have to watch long minutes of story to find myself teleported to some other place that has nothing to do with what I just experienced. And of course there is the main weakness of this series, the premise. The premise has always been so f*ing ridiculous that it begs for explanations that come way too slow and most of the time are huge letdowns. Here I feel once again like missed half the movie when I entered the theatre, and having played the other games and knowing the characters actually makes it *more* confusing. Yet for long hours there isn't even a hint what's going on, and I neither know where I am nor how I got there, what I'm looking for and why. Maybe the game will explain later why the player character seems so completely clueless and emotionally disconnected, but he certainly doesn't help. More than in other entries I grew bored of the actual gameplay loop where 2 hours in felt like I've fought the same enemies and searched the same furniture for much longer, and the combat is a tiresome affair with lot of automatisms and quick time events that, once again, take away control and immersion and feel like work. While the design and atmosphere are great, and the story as confusing as intruiging, the bad port, design flaws and the weird refusal of the game to let me play it because it wants it's oh so cinematic moments made me stop playing this even faster than the other entries.

1441,resident-evil-village,ErayTellezi,"Jul 19, 2021",8,"Oynanış, boss dizaynı falan klasik resident evil. 7'nin direkt devamı ve eski oyunların öncesine yani felaketin nasıl başladığına ve Umbrella'nın kuruluşuna dair bir kaç bilgi de var.Oyunda 4+1 kötü karakter var. Sırayla hepsiyle kapışıyoruz.Oynanış ve tema olarak birbirlerinden farklılar. Bazıları aksiyon bazıları bulmaca ağırlıklı. Hatta bir bölüm boyunca ve sonundaki boss savaşında silah dahi kullanmıyoruz.Hikaye olarak fena değildi, baş düşmanın motivasyonu yerindeydi ama son bölüm hariç neredeyse hiç görmedik.Köy atmosferi güzeldi ama ben 2, 3 ve 7'deki sürekli peşimizden gelen boss'ların verdiği tedirginlik hissini daha çok seviyorum.Bunun yanında 7 ve 2'nin aksine oyunda cephane ve envanter alanı çoktu. Cephane sıkıntısı neredeyse hiç yaşamadım, ateş ederken mermi saymadım.Tabanca hariç diğer silahları kullanmak çok zevkliydi. Tabancadaki oturaklılık hissi 2'ye göre hiç yoktu. Düşmanların parçalanma efekti de kaldırılmış.İlk 4 boss ve bölüm arasında en sevdiğim fabrikalı olandı.İkincisi uzun kadınlı ama ondan değil güve sürüsüne dönüşen kızlarından dolayı. Oyunun her bölümünde bir ana boss bir kaç tane yan boss oluyor. Onlar da iyiydi hakikaten.Her bölüm bittikten sonra köye dönüp yeni yerlere erişip loot yapıyoruz. Alışveriş yaptığımız dük ilginçti.Sonuçta gerginlik hissinin göreceli olarak azlığından dolayı 2 kadar sevmesem de 3'ten kat kat iyiydi. 7 ile aynı seviyede diyebilirim.",Positive

1443,resident-evil-village,LoletinAlexis,"Jul 17, 2021",9,"Resident Evil Village is a jewel that enters directly to the Top 5 of the saga.And yes, RE8 > RE7. *STORY*: Set a few years after the chilling events of the acclaimed Resident Evil 7, this brand new story opens with Ethan Winters and his wife Mia living peacefully in a new place, far from past nightmares. However, just as they are beginning their new life together, tragedy strikes again. Narratively well spun, modifying the origin of the saga and creating the future of the saga at the same time, it's a show where everything is millimetrically thought out.Why not 5 stars? Because of the lack of use of some characters that showed a lot of potential and, in the end, were left wanting more screen time. *GAMEPLAY*: Practically identical to its predecessor, but this time polished and expanded, it is simply perfect. *GRAPHICS*: While something more graphically impressive was expected, it's still a beast, and artistically it's the best of 2021 without a doubt. *SOUND*: This time the soundtrack takes a step aside to give more relevance to the sound effects... And how well it does it.The Spanish dubbing, again, very good. *INNOVATION: Resident Evil Village is not what we expected: it's something better.Clearly inspired by Resident Evil 4, one of its best installments, we are facing another of the pillars of the series that takes RE7 and simply takes it further.",Positive

1446,resident-evil-village,Babutto,"Jul 16, 2021",6,"The game is a big disappointment after RE Biohazard. Pros.:- Characters of Duke, Lady D., her daughters.- Further development of Ethan's story, its closure.- Some connections to the original RE storyline.- Exploration and some small things to upgrade (weapons, food, etc.). That makes gameplay more interesting.- Village and Eastern Europe entourage.- The possibility to 'pause' the exploration of the main storyline and explore the surroundings.- The blend of RE4 and RE2 regarding explorations and gems.- The doll boss and the puzzle to 'escape the room' task. Direct reference to Clancy's 'Birthday' puzzle and Clancy's misfortune. Also, scary and disgusting moment. And now we go to cons. Many many cons.:- Too short with lady D. and daughters, too easy.- Need to have access to all the loot and animals locations regardless you left them or not.- Too much crafting. It's not the same waste Fallout 4 was exploiting but still. In the original you could find the ammo and stuff. Here the developers probably thought ""wait a second, it's the village in the Eastern Europe, you can't find all that ammo. Let's do some crafting. Yeah, scrap metal everywhere"". Well. Even with the original Racoon City it was odd to see all that loot. But that's RE. We love it for it.- Redesign of Chris's face again. It's just a facepalm. They just can't pay the same people who were in 2017 to use their features? Really? Why the hell do you need to change faces over and over again from game to game? It's idiocy. It's just retarded way of the development. Pay 200 shekels and use old Mia and Chris's faces. They didn't even pay to show Evelin's face, mimics. What a dumb cut scene when she was floating above the river talking to Ethan! The were so lazy to add any animation.- Another idiocy is going into blockbuster style. Again. We loved RE Biohazard because it was cameral isolated environment just like IN THE ORIGINAL RE, RE0 and RE2. We love franchise because of this. Not because of CoD style gameplay like in RE5, 6 or here in the second half of the game.- They used only ONE book and a bunch of photos to refer to the old Umbrella corp. and the issue of Spencer. Bravo. Just bravo. Nobody knew anything, Miranda didn't give a damn about Umbrella. It's just Spencer was inspired by her research. And never mentioned her. Anywhere. For the last seven+ games. It's idiocy. Do you even have scriptwriters who PLAYED the games? Why couldn't you connect the events of Las Plagas and Spencer and his company? It was easy: Umbrella and Spencer tried to hire the promising researcher he remembered from the previous years but she refused saying she was busy. Spencer did some research using his fellas (maybe even Wesker) and revealed Miranda works on mold that is a 'parasyte' organism. In a way similar to Las Plagas. Spencer rejects the idea of further development but Wesker takes it into account while creating Uroboros. Bingo!- The game takes too much from Prey. RE is actually System Shock style game (first SS was released before first RE, but SS is an FPS and RE was a 3d person survival adventure horror). So, coming to FPS especially when the main character is mold - direct reference to Prey and their mimics. In the Louisiana environment and mysterious events with the Baker family it was fine. But here with more action it looks too obvious. So, the game worth playing. But it's a step down from RE Biohazard. Story is much dumber, less promising, less touching, less interesting. And the ending is garbage. I would rather play a game entirely in the castle and with lady Dimitrescu as a main villain than this.",Average

1450,resident-evil-village,HotsauceHuncho,"Jul  4, 2021",8,"My first resident evil game as well as my first review.There was a lot of hype surrounding this game and i decided that I might as well jump in and see if the series is worth my time. To answer this question; absolutely. The game looks fantastic and the sound design is top notch (but that is to be expected with most triple A game titles these days) and i didn't experience a single bug in the entire play through. This game does a great job at setting the stage and things can get really intense at times, especially in the early game. Late game you become kind of unstoppable so the fear kind of takes a sharp dive. Regardless, most enemies won't go down too easily and weapons have a decent feel and weight, as well as enemy reactions feeling nice and heavy for the most part. The characters are also all very intriguing and the story never really gets dull. I think that this is more of an action/adventure game than survival horror but it does and great job regardless. This game is also quite short; I explored extensively and it only took me around 10 hours to finish the game on normal difficulty. Overall this is a very good game and for me it was a nice introduction to the RE franchise. I will definitely be checking out RE7 due to my experience with this game. This earns an 8.3 for me because of the length of the game and the fact that it became a little too easy on normal difficulty. That being said, I still think it is well worth the purchase and is a great introduction to the series for myself.",Positive

RTX disabled Fps sits at 50 to 65 easy. RTX Thoughts, For whatever reason, the developers went with RTX reflections only and while they are good they are not impressive by any means. In my opinion it is best to disable RTX entirely on this game. In fact I'd be hard pressed to enable RTX in any enabled game right now as the results are just not that great or too intensive for what they are. Plot: Character: Ethan Winters 2nd time in SeriesWhat happens? Ethan's supposed wife Mia is shot and killed by Chris Redfield and Baby Rose Kidnapped and taken to a village to be given to a cult leader who wants to raise her dead daughter from within and use Roses body parts to form a connection. How long is it? If you go slow the game can last 12 to 13 hours, I took my time and completed it in 18 hours lol as also Died a few times of course. Thoughts? Honestly rather annoyed, Lady D haunted our screens for MONTHS, we all thought she was playing a MAJOR role in Village and she is at best in the game for 30 minutes if that. Her Daughters don't even get me started on those brats, they are in the game for 10 minutes at best. I was rather annoyed with this, Lady D haunted all of screens for months, trailers all pointed to her being a big baddie for us to run from and Nope. Now of course Youtubers of all sorts will make an hour video of them just running around being chased by her and Lady D repeating the same 5 lines over and over and over again as she just didn't record much. It's a shame really, the Developers, Trailers, Game play videos all made it sound like she was to be a Huge plot device but nope 30 minutes and... She Gone. Disappointing as all H. Price: 65$ NOT worth the price at all, If you enjoyed 7 you will maybe like this, I for one hated my time with it.

Resident Evil Village definitely feels like it went back to its roots, but it’s still able to capture that suffocating horror of Biohazard.  This time around, things just got a little weirder and more action-packed. Although largely the same as Resident Evil 7, there is definitely a much different feel here.  While 7 focused more on traversing tight spaces, minimal lighting, and close-quarters combat; this was more open, more vibrant with faster gameplay.  What you miss out on is the intimate horror of Biohazard, but in return, you get a very intricately designed world with some truly grotesque enemies and bosses.  It doesn’t completely shy away from horror (one part in particular terrified me), but it’s definitely not the focus. Village actually felt like a proper Resident Evil game and one that I absolutely enjoyed.

1470,resident-evil-village,Opamant,"May 23, 2021",10,"11/10 and here is why:I don't like residents in 1st person view, re7 - example, re7 is not bad, but re2re is much much better. But Re8 is an another story, Capcom understand that 1st person view is only for dynamic shooters, not for jsut slow walking + puzzling - re7. So in RE8 they did faster gameplay as a shooter + they saved atmospher from re7 and improved it + added some things from re4 + puzzling much better designed for 1st view. RE8 it's a brilliant horror shooter with good story and characters + tiny of RPG. Graphics and Design are really at very high level, scripts are not so easy to recognize. In gameplay very less void zones, if enabling brain you will not get bored till the end. My favorite location is Castle ofcourse, i love vintage and castle visual disign are incredible + heisenberg's working gear wheels in the same game!. But i expected actually more from it (in gameplay parts i mean of the castle) And the game is big, much bigger than re3...). I actually though while played, so where the game's end??!? Residents never was open world like RDR2 or Days gone or even Horizon. But i replay RE8 5 times at different difficulties and want more (Btw i did speedruns and can tell that speedrun actually kill the game especially atmosphere). One of criteria of a really good game is replayability, when you wanting to replay game after you end it. Secret shop as usual for RE games changing style of playing/walkthrough.Im not RE super fan, but i love classic re2 and Nemesis/Veronica and played on CRT TV in them, so while playing RE8: i see puzzle or closed door and think.. damn.. to open it i will spend 2 hourse of my time like in all resindents, but no, solution is in 5-10 min depends of your accuracy - and this is very good for 1st person game.Some times i even read minds from developers while playing re8. I though they wanted to do doom eternal finishig moves on lycans but they do it on you ;). And after i end the game i had tones of exciting emotions and saw titles to the end, the last game did this to me was Horizon zero dawn. Want to add that Re2re and RE8 it's a very different games, Re8 it's a big step forward from Capcom in 1st person horror and in horror overall. And i can congratulate you Capcom finally you did your first brilliant 1st person horror as you always wanted to do, starting from PS1 games...) And now im waiting Code Veronica Remake in 3rd person..:)",Positive

The game has more action than resident evil 7 (not a bad thing), it balances perfectly horror and action, creating a unique playability, in the entire game the atmosphere flows between the two of them, switching depending the areas and enemies. The bossfights were great, except one of them.The story is sophisticated, interesting and thrilling, the rhytm is a bit slow in some parts but not for too long, as you advance in the game you will fell like if you were in a fable. The characters and antagonists are pretty nice, the most charismatic one is Karl Heisenberg, on the other hand, Ethan becomes a more interesting character in this one playing the role of father.Something bad about the gameplay, the enemies moves by zones,what i mean with this is that if you walk away of an specific area were some enemies appear they will inmediatly turn and get away from there.Personally, i really enjoyed the game, there is people saying that the game is too short, the game lasts 10 hours and if we have in mind the replayability and the extra mode ""the mercenaries"" that is going to give us a lot more hours (like every resident evil game).

1477,resident-evil-village,verygameryname,"May 19, 2021",9,"Resident Evil Village is one of the best game in this long RE franchise. The characters are really unique and some have their backstory, Ethan Winters (the guy we played) really have developed from the events of RE 7 (the bakers incident), he freaks out sometimes but most of the time he talks **** and challanged the boss which i found quite funny, The bosses are also very unique in their own way and i'm glad their backstory was explained not from some cutscene, the best boss was probably Karl Heissenberg which was the last of the 4 lords, Lady D have the look but Heissenberg have the personality and charisma, Donnie and angie boss fight section was the scariest part of the game and i see this part is probably what Silent Hill could have been. The gun gameplay is nice and the puzzle rewards was very rewarding, The Duke merchant was also a nice thing to add. The Chris Redfield part was great and i get some of DOOM vibes while playing him, although i really wish capcom makes it longer. Pros:1.Great action/horror game2.Great gameplay3.NGL but grown up rose kinda pretty4.Perfect emotional scene Cons:1.Not much ammo tho, in my case, sometimes i have few ammo left after defeating boss or stronger enemies. Conclusion: It's a GOTY contender but i'd be suprised to see this game wins it",Positive

The beginning is a bit slow, and I really like the slow and steady way the tension is built. You are not a killing machine and you have often this need for survival. As you progress and become stronger the game becomes a more action feeling which I really liked. It offers everything! Action, Horror!!! (there is an area in the game where I was REALLY scared the WHOLE time....and turned off the sound to manage to go through....), some relaxing moments where you craft ammunition or just look around when the bad guys are dead, Exploration etc. It has a huge replay value! Graphics, Sound, Story telling and controls are fantastic.  You cant compare it to RE4 but I think both games are fantastic. RE 4 in my opinion a better protagonist, Leon is more interesting and this makes the game a bit better! But this is only personal taste. To all the Resident Evil fans, buy it without second thought!!!",Positive

1493,resident-evil-village,ScienceAdvisor,"May 16, 2021",5,"RE: Village has Good Graphics, but terrible story, silly plot, artifical difficulty, and one of the worst mechanics I have ever seen in a game - blocking blades and giant weapons with bare hands.  The internal mechanics are inconsistent, with one enemy type (flies) being vulnerable to something when convienent, and invulnerable to it when inconvienent.  Many aspects of the story fail under any level of scrutiny, such as where did all the people come from to be monsterized?  They even go full magic at various times, and not just for bosses.  It also suffers from cut-scene-itis, with far too many locking you from actually being able to play the game.  The lycan slobbering on your face one is particularly annoying, and does not give any way to cut it short as it did back in RE:4.  In fact I would not even call this a RE game, this is something else with a few of the trappings of the RE franchise. The silly part is that the devs want you to play this multiple times, yet did not build the game with nearly enough randomization to keep it interesting.  So on subsequent playthroughs it gets old pretty fast.  People keep claiming this is the spiritual successor to RE:4, but if so, it is the idiot cousin as RE:4 has far more engaging mechanics, and combat that is far more satisfying due to variety of combinations.  In RE:Village, it just gets very bullet spongy. One noteworthy bug is that the ""lycans"" (which are allergic to flour apparently) animation does not play properly, so you have to start your block about 1 second early.",Average
1494,resident-evil-village,Watatsumi,"May 16, 2021",9,"This was my first RE game that I played, though i've watched RE games since 1 so you can take this as a layman's review: The visuals, the gameplay, the story and bosses for most of the game is memorable, beautiful and really fun to encounter. This game is one of the most fun first person game I've played in a while. The only issues I've had with it boil down to the Heisenberg boss battle and Chris's lvl being excessive action shooter gameplay that was not frightening at all. A colleague of mine who's played every game found these two parts annoying and just flat in its delivery of what he enjoys from these games: puzzles, crazy zombies/bosses, and fear. And I cant disagree with him. How you beat Heisenberg almost felt as ridiculous as chris punching boulders all over again. and Being Chris with endless bullets and grenades that take everything down instantly is just... well boring. That being said, exploring the village and experiencing the first bosses and their respective locations makes this game a well worth buy.

From the graphics to the writing  to the voice acting. Gunplay too. All top notch. This game kept me interested and focused all the way through. Trying to find every treasure and item to be had.

Complaints of the game being too short are ill-founded in my opinion. Great graphics.  Minor use of ray-tracing and good implementation of HDR.  Bummer that DLSS was not implemented. Pretty solid gameplay. The only negative comments is that the weapon upgrade system could be refined.

Addresses some of the issues I had with the RE-games (the old ones they made remakes of), ""tyrants"" are now fun and interesting to face (they were just an annoyance in the old games). No more ridiculous difficulty levels where missing one bullet means the game needs to be restarted. No more ""over-the-top"" puzzles. Some might call this a bad thing, but I think the changes are for the good - the more interesting story and enjoyable fighting has replaced what was previously padded out with frustrating sections that was just hard for the sake of slowing down your progression. Gives you a bit of a taste of different horror genres and lots of interesting characters with a unique feel to them. Its really hard to find to something to complain about in this game. Perhaps I would have liked a bit more enemy variety and some cooler weapons to play with, its mostly rather traditional stuff.

This is a first person survival horror game with more of an emphasis on weapons than purely sneaking and sriviving.. which works in this setting, but I would’ve liked this to be more gradual.Here once again like in resident evil 7 you play as ethan winters, searching for his daughter rose after their home is ambushed and the both of you are kidnapped, you find yourself in a village full of vampire meets werewolf character, and its so refreshing to not deal with lame zombies or mold creatures.. these enemies are terrifying when you first run into them… but I woulve loved a gradual lead up to actually getting some weapons in hand muck like in resident evil 7.. sneaking around this village, sneaking through the castle trying not to get caught as you got the items you needed, until finally you get a weapon, blast your way out of the castle and destroy the enemies in the village.. instead I almosti mmediatly felt untouchable.. which really killed the scary aspect of village for me.. there were definitely erie moments here for me.. but I never felt terrified the way I did in past resident evil games.. but as a more action almost first person devil may cry feeling game… village is great.. and I absolutely love the attention to detail and variety here… resident evil village is constantly switching up the areas as you set out to take down multiple targets in a vastly different setting from eachother.. theres so much to collect, find and upgrade like the older resident evil games, with the map color indicator letting you know when you’ve grabbed everything, and these a shop that just pops up along your journey to upgrade your weapons, buy ammo, or sell these crystals you pick up off of enemies, really giving you incentive to be aggressive here.. trying to afford all of the upgrades you can for your weapons..Resident evil village does get a little lame and obring in its final stretch. .but they all do..  but not nearly as bad as 7 biohazard… if youre ready for resident evil to get back to the way it used to but don’t want to let go the creepiness first person adds to the series.. resident evil village is a perfect mix.. I do again just wish they tried to scare me a little bit more… much like in the maiden demo… more of that mixed into resident evil village, and this couldve reached masterpiece level..I give Resident Evil Villagea 9/10",Positive

The game length is perfect, the combat, graphics, sound design, all perfect. I have verrrrrry few complaints where the actual game is concerned. However, I do have issues with the port itself in terms of UI navigation. Navigating any menu or even the map on mouse and keyboard is awkward and counterintuitive. It works, and I really don't take THAT much issue with it, but it is there. It's workable, I can live with it, but for those that find these things a big issue, it's worth noting.

If yes, you are gonna love Village and the opposite. Village took the same formula from RE7 and expanded it in pretty much everything, characters, locations, weapons and story. Are all these changes welcome? Well, it depends on what kind of Resident Evil player you are. If you prefer the OG RE games to the new ones, like 4, then you are probably not gonna get the experience you want. Even if you liked 7, it is not guarranteed you will love this one. Having said that, nothing in this game is poorly made and out of character. It is a great Resident Evil and in my opinion a fine installment to the series. The voice acting is top notch with the cheesy, b movieness you'd expect from a Resident Evil. The graphics are breathtaking with some painting-beautiful vistas.

The game feels amazing with great atmosphere and a very solid story that (for me) changed my perspective on Ethan Winters for the better and I can't wait to see what comes next, though, the ending did leave me worried as for what happens in the next installment to the other characters given that it sets up Rose (now a young adult) as a new main character.. and for the record I would be very interested in Ethan coming back in the future in whatever form because I will be missing this guy..",Positive

1539,resident-evil-village,tec,"May 11, 2021",8,"Coming from a RE-Vet. RE is since 7 a fps horror shooter and 8 is no different. BUT it´s more fleshed out than the previous entry, the horror varies now, we explore a village which feels a mixture between RE4 and Bloodborne, Afterwards we visit a Castle which has more of the classic RE feeling like the mansion. Without spoilering further, we get a feeling of P.T., condemned, outlast & house of the dead the more we progress. Weapons are upgradeable, exploration is rewarded with more coins or even equipment or upgrades. Enemy variety is ok, nothing spectacular but at least more than in RE2&3 R. Story is as every RE a mixture of over the top and your average horror clichee.As almost every RE game 8 is no different in replayablitity. You unlock the mercs mode after finishing the main game and can buy weapons or infinite munition for challange points which you get after doing certain things ingame like finishing the game with knife only or find every collectible.The puzzles are as flat as these from the remakes but resident evil is not a horror puzzle game since at least 6 so that´s that. My rating is a 7.5 out of 10 but i round it up since the game is at least worth a play trough.",Positive

The graphics are great, but the environments are repetitive and boring, all with virtually the same dreary colours, making what could have been a great village map into an eye-sore. The dialogue is sub-par too, and the character of Chris Redfield has been brought down by this instalment.

1570,resident-evil-village,argonwow1,"May 10, 2021",5,"An average game. The first couple hours of the game are great, you get the feel of RE7 with the nostalgia pop of RE4 but that eventually wears off.The story itself borrows a number of things from RE7 and a lot of the characters are similar in style. It feels like an attempt at a call back to the previous RE7 characters but considering RE7 came out only a few years ago it just feels like laziness instead. The callbacks to RE4, however, were actually nice.The ending was not great and I came away feeling more annoyed than anything else though I am glad it didn't end the way I thought it would after playing for a few hours but it was still a massive disappointment to me.The gameplay is fun but it doesn't make up for the constant comparisons you'll be making with previous, better, games in the franchise.There are also a number of continuity errors that make replaying or watching a playthrough after having finished the game a bit painful. All in all I wouldn't recommend this game unless it's on sale, you'll feel far more fulfilled going back and playing 4 and 7 again than this mashup.",Average

It's very obvious what Capcom is doing right now, so if you hate these new games, you might as well leave this series for next 2 years. RE Village is most obvious inspiration from RE4 and everyone already knows that RE4 Remake will be next RE game. That's what Resident Evil is and will be until at least 2023. Deal with it. That's what this series is and most people seem to absolutely love it. It's crazy how good reviews it gets on steam. But to be completely fair, if you don't like Resident Evil 4, i don't like you anyway. Would recommend Village to anyone (even people who are new to RE series) who wants to have fun, lots of boss battles, great graphics and weapon upgrades. People who say it doesn't have horror at all are simply lying. Or maybe their definition of horror is just hiding in the corner. That's something i call pathetic, not horror, but to each their own.

1596,resident-evil-village,Sholva,"May  9, 2021",10,"Where to start, I guess to put it simply, Resident Evil Village is a very good game, and a very good Resident Evil game at that, too. Capcom weren’t joking when they said they put a lot of effort into making sure the actual village in the game is a character on its own. But it’s not just the village, really; their marketing team made quite sure not to show us a lot of the game and…there’s a lot of game here besides just “tall vampire lady”, her castle and a village. It’s simply one of the most unique Resident Evil games so far, with many varied environments and areas to explore. It’s also not a short Resident Evil game, it’s not the longest, perhaps RE 4 or 6 hold that title, I’d say, but it has a decent duration if you take your time or, like me, your first playthrough is on Hardcore Difficulty. I was never bored by any of the new areas we visit in the game; there are four main areas, each one corresponding to one of the four Lords in the game, but there are also other areas and side zones to discover.The seamless transitions between areas in this game (there are no loading screens), make it look like it’s actually pretty decently sized and it feels great. It was already after I completed Dimitrescu’s Castle that I thought to myself: “Oh yeah, this is definitely a very good Resident Evil game” and I have to say that whoever are responsible for designing this Castle at Capcom did a very good job, it’s an amazing place to explore early in the game and a 120% Resident Evil experience. The amount of detail put into these designs is really something. Same can be said about the remaining zones in the game, after how incredible the Castle is, it’s difficult to top that, but I was very pleasantly surprised by the areas that we get to explore later in the game as well. There was not a single zone or area that seemed poorly designed or rushed to me, and each new area brought something new and different into the gameplay. One of my favorite sections of the game does not even involve combat in any way, without getting into spoilers: it was incredible, and scary as hell, didn’t last as long as the Castle, but the intensity and tension were off the charts in there, so it really felt longer than it is, because it was so well executed. I really liked that Ethan has now an actual developed personality in this game, compared to the previous one, the character has come a long way and we get to see so many aspects of him in this game. As in the most recent games, all the characters are really well done and the voice actors and motion capture performers (which are the same for the English audio, mostly, they do the voices and the capture themselves) really once again did a very good job with all of them. Of course, having played the latest RE games I instantly recognized some familiar voices, and I’m glad because they are all really good actors and I’m happy that Capcom is taking care of their voice and performance talent here. When it comes to this specific PC version of the game, I found it runs pretty decently on my Ryzen 5 3600 and RTX 3060 Ti setup It is definitely a more demanding game than RE 7, RE 2 and 3 remakes, and we even have the option to use Ray Tracing now, making it even more demanding. But it is also the best looking RE Engine game so far, that is undoubtedly true as well. That’s not to say the game looks bad without RT, it doesn’t, I think it still looks great without it as well. I did find an issue with the game that should be patched: minimizing the game, or switching settings once we’re in game can lock the game into a very low frame-rate state only fixable by restarting the game and this was already an issue in the demo too. This can be avoided by leaving to the main menu and making the changes in there, but it’s still an annoying issue. There’s also no FOV slider present in the options, a big oversight, considering all the recent games have it, and I hope it gets patched in soon, but for now there are mods out there that work to increase the FOV, with no issues. Overall, this game is an incredible survival horror experience from start to finish, that continues the story that RE 7 started, and ties in with the lore of the whole series with some very cleverly placed allusions and clues, and not so subtle ones as well.RE Village is so good that it even enhances all of what RE VII did, making the both of them a cohesive experience very much worth revisiting back to back, and I think that's really great. The RE Engine once again continues to evolve into the new generation so…good job Capcom, this one was pretty good.",Positive

This game is way more intriguing than lady d even though i know a few people who bought the game for the memes my friends stayed for the story i think Heisenberg was even more interesting and mother Miranda, the action in the  game was beautifully executed i felt like a bad ass, and i genuinely liked Ethan way more as a character the plot twist and how things all add up in the end was amazing, Ethan is a g, best father out there and one of the best re character in the franchise, not only do you bond and relate to the character Ethan, he is a really good guy a man who wants to protect his family, and you mourn for Ethan, Capcom did an amazing job of making you actually care for Ethan anytime a director or game developer add a new mc people always b*tch about how they aren't as cool as the og characters, but Ethan is arguably the best written character and better than some of the og characters, but its pretty even with Leon and Chris id say these 3 are the big trio for RE franchise, also this game is pretty f**king scary not too scary but you get a lot of ""OH SH^T!"" moments, now during the doll house mission is truly a horrifying experience when you reach to that part get ready for some spooky ass sh*t, but overall a good horror action game, definitely recommend to try its fun af you probably wont enjoy the beginning as much but as you get deeper into the game you're going to have fun 10/10.",Positive

This doesn't include the ""twist"" (air-quotes).

Just cause you can fight back and upgrade guns, doesn't mean that game is not scary anymore. This logic makes no sense. Having guns and actually fighting your way through scary locations, fighting scary enemies, trying to survive, scary ambient music. That's what horror games are all about. That's what makes them enjoyable. Resident Evil 4 did it already in 2005 and Dead Space (inspired by Resident Evil 4) did it in 2008, but for some reason this amazing concept got lost in time.

Boss fights are one of the main reasons i re-play games over and over again. If boss fights are bad, i wont go back that often. But when i know there's tons of cool bosses coming, then there's a reason to re-play some more boring regions of the game. But thankfully RE Village doesn't have many boring regions.

1649,resident-evil-village,abowman,"May  8, 2021",6,"I played the game for about 90 minutes before I decided to refund the game. These games don't even feel like resident evil anymore. I keep hoping I'll have my mind changed, but every new game in the series is a further step in the wrong direction. The gameplay almost feels like Its one step up from legends of grimrock. The combat and guns are very unresponsive and feel like I'm shooting a BB gun. The mobs hardly stagger unless you're using a shotgun, and there is a VERY basic block/parry system. The mobs are bullet sponges and there isn't much to the gunplay besides aiming for the head and holding the block button if they get close. The first major where you have to hold your ground against some war wolves is ultimately what made up my mind to refund the game. The game doesn't tell you what you're actually suppose to do during this part of the game. It seems like there is a very bad scripted scene where a mob is suppose to throw you into the river, but it's not clear at all what actually triggers this. I would kill a bunch of mobs, run around the map for several minutes, and I even tried a combination of the two a few times. Even after watching a video I still failed to trigger the event after a few more attempts. Ultimately I was approaching the two hour refund window, realized I wasn't having fun at all, and ended up refunding the game. You can read several complaints about this scripted scene on the steam discussion forum. The game is basically a scripted corridor simulator without a shred of horror. Obviously I seem to be the minority in my opinion, so maybe RE is simply appealing to a new fanbase now. I'm glad people seem to be enjoying the new Resident Evil's, but I just can't seem to get into these new resident evil games at all.",Average
1650,resident-evil-village,Steyraus,"May  8, 2021",10,"I loved RE7, Loved it. IMO its up there with the greats in Survival Horror history. It had the Atmosphere and setting that made for a Masterpeice. I am Happy to say Capcom has made Lighning strike twice with RE8V. Its got everything 7 had with an awsome new setting and even some improvments. The bigest improvment is combat, its more previlent and always keeps you on your back foot. I hear alot of new horrors fans claiming combat takes away the fear in these game and they want all horror games to be these walking simulators we got dozens of this generation. That is rubish. Combat is an intregal part of true survival horror. Go back and play the OG resident Evil and Silent Hill.games they are full.of shooting. It just that later games were larger so there was more of everything including enemyencounters.The trick is to ballance the combat. Ammo conservation, lining up the shot and positioning is what builds tension in true survival horror. Not just jump scares and mountains of blood and gore.If you run from an enemy because runing is the only mechanic at your disposal, that to scary, thats not tension. When you run because you cant trust your self to line up a shot due to low ammo , your location being to constictive and the heaviness of the situation, thats true fear and tension.I really wish people would stop making statments like combat in survival horror makes it just like COD. The last 8 years  have been terible for horror all we have got is walking simulators. The RE games are the last games staying true to the genre. Just let us have these games.. If you truly cant understand the nuances and complexities between the different controls and mechanics in diferent genres, do you really need to give an opinion..

Nothing in this game is too difficult to find and all the puzzles are reasonable, but still new and intriguing.The black, sharp-toothed, and slimy amalgamation creatures called “The Molded” which take the place of zombies are hard to kill and disturbing to look at, plus their spawns are not only random but appear in unexpected ways. I had one drop through the ceiling, completely catching me off guard!The bosses of this game are no hidden object. Each one is shown clearly to you and through papers and notes it’s explained how they are just normal residents until they come into contact with a certain, inhuman substance.Since we are talking about the bosses I might as well talk about the boss battles. This game contains some of the most unique boss battles I’ve ever seen in video games. With multiple ways to play them, and mortifying character designs these have been the scariest, and the most creative boss fights I’ve EVER experienced. Except for the final boss battle. That one was a bit underwhelming. Still doesn’t detract from the rest of the game though.The map has a compact/claustrophobic feel, but is actually much bigger than it looks. There are so many routes and passageways that lead to many different areas plus some convenient shortcuts to help you get back to old areas faster. I truly applaud the level designers for their ingenuity when creating this amazing set!So to wrap up, this is a truly great throwback to the older start of the franchise with new and modern features to make it a more interesting play.",Positive

Por um lado é bom para recompensar a exploração mais minuciosa, mas por outro é muito anti-intuitivo.A atmosfera do jogo e a ambientação são ótimas, mas eu sinto que focou demais no terror, na opressão, às vezes até no grotesco e bizarro, e isso meio que me tira um pouco a diversão, tratando-se de um resident evil, onde uma das coisas que mais gosto é o gerenciamento de itens definir mais o combate que se você está nervoso com um inimigo que você não consegue enfrentar direito por ele ser muito resistente e ser um saco acertar na cabeça.No mais, acho um bom jogo, com boms personagens e com um rumo que não foi ruim pra franquia.

Great sound design, Amazing graphics and great characters (except from the main character).I've tried this game 2 times. First time I stopped at the marguerite boss fight. That fight took way too long with no progress indication. Resulting in a very irritating fight. Second time I stopped at the Chainsaw boss fight. Entered with 0 bullets, resulting in an annoying knife fight. The tank controls are fine, but with the addition of accelerated animations of enemies when you're ""too"" far away make it unfair and annoying. The game is not scary (at least in my opinion). This makes the hide and seek parts the most annoying in the game. As a player I'm not scared of Jack. But the game forces me to hide, making reaching your destination or solving a puzzle not fun and even annoying.  Jack even teleports in front of you after some time. Yes, its surprising, but takes away any strategy regarding the route you take etc. The goo enemies are bullet sponges and hard to sidestep in the beginning of the game. There is no indicator of your health (except from the abstract blood on the screen). All this resulted in 2 just not fun playthroughs.I appreciate what they did, reviving the RE franchise and I think first person was the right step. But this isn't it for me. And RE8 is, in my opinion, not the right evolution either.Again RE7 has its qualities, but the annoying gameplay made this game simply not fun for me.",Average

The resource management is what really got me hooked, trying to complete each encounter in the most efficient way possible and every small upgrade felt meaningful.I didn't particularly think the story and the main character of Ethan Winters were the most compelling (I enjoyed Jack's character more) but it was enough to keep me interested. I didn't think I'd survive the night, but I did and I loved every bit of it.",Positive
1716,resident-evil-7-biohazard,MaliPiksi,"Dec  4, 2021",8,"Great horror from a great franchise. Everybody in the gaming community has heard about Resident Evil. RE7 is a bit of a different experience compared to older games, since they switched to 1st person. A welcome change and it really makes it scarier. The story is confusing. I had no idea who the characters were and what was going on. Even at the end of the game, they do explain a bit. but it's still not clear to me. I heard that RE8 completes the story and explains a lot but I haven't played it. All in all, it's weird in a scary way. Gameplay is basic. Run around and shoot monsters. The mechanics are pretty ""eh"". But it all works, so it's not bad or anything, just basic. Enemies respawning gets repetitive and if you keep fighting, you just lose a lot of ammo. Horror is good. I had moments where I genuinely panicked a bit. It's creepy and disgusting, very visual and brutal. Being constantly chased by the enemy makes you uneasy and it had me running around looking for the way out of that area. Graphics are good. Both environments and enemies look solid. I recommend to put the brightness as low as you can, it may be harder but it's scarier that way. Personally I'm not a fan of horror, but I enjoyed Resident Evil 7. The free DLC is also a good addition to the story. People who love a horror will not be disappointed.",Positive

1723,resident-evil-7-biohazard,Klazy,"Aug 14, 2021",8,"Kurzinfos:Resident Evil 7 Biohazard von CapcomResident Evil 7 Biohazard ist ein Survival-Horror-First-Person-Shooter und hat die USK 18.Das Spiel ist für die PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, Google Stadia erschienen und ist aktuell im Gamepass enthalten.Meine Spielzeit belief sich auf ca. 11h.58 Errungenschaften sind zu bekommen Handlung:Man spielt Ethan Winters der eine Nachricht von seiner verschwundenen Frau bekommt. Daraufhin macht man sich auf den Weg sie zu finden. Als man dann an einem verlassenen Haus ankommt beginnt die spannende Horrorstory. Während des Spiels absolviert man Rätsel und muss Objekte finden die man fürs weiterkommen braucht. Gameplay:(Controller)Das Gameplay läuft einwandfrei, sodass sich das Spiel fließend spielen lässt. Die Horrorpassagen kommen gut zur Geltung. Die Story ist klar strukturiert. Es gibt einen großen Kritikpunkt. Mir ist häufiger der PC gecrasht, als ich das Spiel spielte und zwischendurch auf einen anderen Monitor wechselte. Durch die Auto Safe Funktion war es jetzt nicht dramatisch. Der Controller wechselte manchmal zwischen Player 1 und Player 2, sofern man von etwas runter sprang oder etwas ausführen wollte. Das stört nicht es sei denn man befindet sich in einem Kampf und kann 1-2 Sekunden nichts drücken. Das Inventar ist generell zu klein, sodass man sein Inventar an der Truhe leeren muss. Den VR Modus konnte ich nicht austesten jedoch würde er ziemlich gut zu dem Spiel passen. Sound:Der Sound passt sehr gut ins Spiel und vermittelt eine Düstere und Spannende Stimmung.Die Sounds der Waffen hören sich passend an. Die deutsche Synchronstimmen passen zu den Charakteren. Umgebungsgeräusche erhöhen den Horrorspaß. Grafik:An der Grafik ist nichts auszusetzen. Die Umgebung und Charaktere passen zu der düsteren Grundstimmung. Die Bosse sind sehr gut ausgedacht und animiert. Fazit:Resident Evil 7 ist mein erstes Resident Evil und ich möchte jetzt alle Spielen. Egal ob Vorgänger oder nachfolgende Teile. Die Umgebung und Soundtracks haben mich direkt überzeugt und die Story hat mich gefesselt. Trotz der ein oder anderen nervigen Probleme wollte ich das Spiel nicht aufhören zu spielen.

The game evolved into FPS but with survival horror, System Shock, Bioshock-like elements. There are familiar save spots (audio recorders and boxes). You progress through the locations and open them more and more. You may come back and find forgotten secrets or items. You still may kill, but should keep an eye on the inventory. All from the past and best of RE games.- Story. Even though the story AGAIN is about a ""small little girl with superpowers"" (F.E.A.R., movies like ""Ring"", etc.) it is explained through the virus and experimentation. The virus resembles Uroboros. Still, Evelyn is a vulnerable kid with family issues. Her behavior and dramatic consequences are the results of the mistakes of the adults actually.- Characters. Amazing characters of the Baker family, especially Jack (""Howdy"") and Lucas. Fantastic development, animation, interactions. It horrifying in several episodes.- DLCs are finally worth their money. All DLCs are cool, especially 21, The Room, Sisters. Didn't feel I finished the game without finishing DLCs, especially Nightmare (it was a hell of an experience). Cons.:- Not enough upgrades. Inventory could be more flexible and comfortable to surf.- Need more background stories about Evelyn and Blue Umbrella.- Redesign of Chris. Ugh... When will they stop redesigning well-established characters?.. Still, fantastic game. Must buy!",Positive
1728,resident-evil-7-biohazard,Sepherim,"Jul 10, 2021",8,"Resident Evil VII es sin duda un muy buen juego, aunque poco tiene que ver con un RE tradicional. Para empezar, la historia solo tiene algun puntual punto de conexión con el resto de juegos anteriores (obviamente, con Village tendrá muchos más, pero aun no lo he jugado), y no solo en el sentido de conexiones directas, sino que pasamos de una historia típica de zombies (plagas, Virs T o lo que sea) a una historia más de casa encantada con asesinos inmortales (a lo Jason). Y el juego cambia también profundamente a nivel de jugabilidad, sigue teniendo elementos de acción, pero regresa más a las raíces en cuanto a la idea de survival horror (escasez de recursos, pocos enemigos pero duros, etc.). Uno de los cambios más notables en cuanto a jugabilidad es que, en esta ocasión, jugamos en primera persona, y no en tercera como solía ser habitual en la saga. El juego también, un poco como el 1, juega mucho más con los tiempos en que no pasa nada, para añadir tensión para los momentos en que sí pasa, alternando momentos de tensa pero pausada exploración con los momentos más de acción/conflicto y algún ocasional toque de sigilo puntual. Añade a eso unos cuantos puzzles, más creíbles en su mayoría que los puzzles típicos de RE, que añaden algo de variedad puntual, aunque reconozco que lo de las sombras a mi me cansó. Eso si, para mi se queda un poco justito en algunos valores importantes como variedad de enemigos y armas, pero sobretodo en duración, algo que espero compensar con los DLCs. Gráficamente no se puede decir que el juego sea ""precioso"" pero sin duda es espectacular. La recreación de la sórdida casa de los Bakers y las tierras que la rodean es profundamente detallada, con distintos ambientes adecuados para cada uno de los miembros y un trabajo estético brutal para hacerla terrorífica e inmersiva incluso cuando no está pasando nada. El sonido contribuye enormemente a esto, con muchos sonidos de cosas naturales (como el crujir de la madera de la casa) que se entremezclan perfectamente con el sonido de los enemigos al moverse (vale la pena jugarlo con cascos con sonido 3D). Las voces están también muy bien y la música, aunque tiene muy poca presencia, se nota cuando aparece. Y, al menos en mi partida, no me he encontrado con ningún bug. Por todo ello, sin duda no diría que es un RE tradicional ni mucho menos, pero es un juego que vale mucho la pena. Un 8,5.",Positive

1733,resident-evil-7-biohazard,Thecaseyoz,"May 26, 2021",9,"Resident evil 7. WOW - The return to the survival horror genre. Lets start with Graphics.I was definitely not expecting this, the opening sequence was lovely to look at, and as we delve deeper into the mysteries of this game, I was shocked at how well everything handled, very rarely did I come across a glitch. Story - I did feel like I had seen a story like this before, Outlast etc. THE HILLBILLY HORROR. however the whole story felt like it was leading to something bigger and greater than Hillbilly Horror which was really nice. There were twists and turns I wasn't expecting and I could return to this game about once a year and still enjoy playing it. Gameplay - Atmosphere, at this point, that's my favourite word when refering to MOST of the Resident Evil Series. Over ONE NIGHT this game manages to take you to plenty of different locations saving you the bordum of playing in the same place for too long. It lets you feel safe at some points of time only to rip that from you in the following chapters. The game does have an emotional aspect to it and it feels. good when you finish the whole story off. This was a great game leading it's players back to what RE once was. The boss design DID feel repetitive however.",Positive

It ""borrows"" (copies) heavily from other sources for monsters/bosses, but I guess not enough to trigger copyright violations.  Overall, a lot of people got a few references and that makes them ultra-clever, so the game must be good.  However, as a whole, that is far from the truth.

Not many games (if any) have managed to put this effect on me. Story is very ok, just a little lightweight, but fully enough. Presentation is great. Some puzzles were mixed in. The whole game seems to be deliberately cut in quantity, but upped in quality, which I think is a great direction.

The scenario looks like something out of a Silent Hill game and the first-person form looks more like a silly Bioshock. The story of the characters lacks much more context, which makes the game quite short. Some weapons are ""cheesy"" like the ""hobbyist"" designed flamethrower and grenade launcher, and Joe's extra set ends up being ridiculous with a ""military gauntlet"" weapon. The game does things that seem like a mockery of itself. They have a poor selection of ""serious weapons"" but it works, although they forget valuable things about their RE4 gem with the weapon upgrades. There are very few enemies and fighting mechanics. The ""power-ups"" in the form of ""coins"" are childish. The knife fights in certain parts are great, and the entire RE6 nexus is welcome to have been cut, but again it's disappointing not to have the character's voice actor Cris Readfield, (nor his face, which is confusing). In conclusion, it is not a good game for a fan of the saga, and it is only a good game for a child outside the plot in general.",Average

1751,resident-evil-7-biohazard,apeot2002,"Apr 23, 2021",8,"Resident Evil 7 is probably most famous for being the Resident Evil game that made the jump from third to first person perspective, and for being the title that redeemed the franchise after the disaster that was RE6. For both things, it is, I think, rightly praised. But there is plenty more cause for admiration here. When the game starts, you are Ethan Winters, on a mission to find your long lost wife, who apparently turned up in a dilapidated mansion in the Louisiana swamp after three years of being missing. That’s all you’ll learn of his back story, and that’s all you need to know. Ethan is the protagonist, but he is not the star of the show. The main gameplay loop is familiar: you explore the various properties of the Baker family, scavenging for weapons, ammunition and items, all the while being in danger from the murderous denizens of the location, which you have to evade or fight off. Occasionally, the game throws an environmental puzzle at you, to spice things up. Combat is a sluggish, uncomfortable affair. Aiming your various guns feels slow and imprecise. Ethan is so slow on his feet that evading your enemies’ attacks is almost impossible. Melee attacks are possible but almost completely ineffective. This is not a detriment to the experience. RE7 is a horror tale, the protagonist is not expected to come out of the mayhem unscathed, and while there is plenty of harm inflicted upon Ethan during cutscenes, it’s quite hard not to get bled during the regular engagements, as well. There is never enough ammunition to actually feel confident during engagements, but usually there is enough to never actually run out. The whole system is balanced really well: It engenders terror, but never frustration. Full marks. Exploration is also great, and this is mostly a credit to the art direction. I usually take a lot of screenshots to memorize the beautiful moments within a game, but while playing RE7, I rarely ever felt the need to make a screenshot. This is a compliment: The locations here are so lovingly crafted examples of irredeemable rot and dirt and dilapidation that I felt the constant urge to wipe my monitor instead. Every surface feels soiled and moist. The soundscape wraps you in squelches and screams and blubbering and so many other disturbing noises.The environment is so scary and oppressive that I breathed a sigh of relief every time I entered a safe room. Those are just as expertly crafted to feel comforting as the rest of the game is to terrorize you, without them feeling out of place. The puzzles are fine. There are no real head scratchers, nothing to get stuck on. They serve to structure the route Ethan takes through the game, and although some of them stretch the limits of suspension of disbelief, none of them broke it for me. The plot is great, I think. A lean tale, mostly unburdened by the convoluted Resident Evil mythos, laser focussed on the struggle between a murderous family of degenerates and their would be victims. The characters are great for what they are. None of them feel really developed, but they don’t have to be: they are great implementations of their tropes, the enemies feel menacing. The few allies you have you build a connection with simply by being in the same horrible situation, and they are likable enough that you feel it when horrible things happen to them. The main villain has a somewhat sympathetic back story, but I hated her with a passion anyway, which made the truly bonkers final confrontation quite cathartic for me. The game is also very well paced. The locations are spacious, but not overly so. There is no filler, every room has a purpose, both within the game world and with regards to the story. You get just enough time within each location to get familiar with them, but before that familiarity can breed feelings of security, you move on. Since we are in an imperfect world, there are a few marks against the game. While the main antagonists are unique and memorable and well designed, at some point the game introduces a couple of rank and file monsters, and those designs, while memorable when first encountered, are very samey. There are three main types, which is too few, and they look very similar. Also, the most impactful moments of the story are front-loaded, so the engagement levels drop a bit during the middle chapters, until the revelations of the final third of the game ratchet things up again. Finally, a word about the DLC: There’s, like, a ton of it, and I only played the story-based one’s but those are excellent additions to the game. They give you more time with the Baker family and, at their best, equal the first hours of the main game in excellence. Well worth your time and money. TLDR: If you ever wanted to to the protagonist of a really good horror movie is scary even if you avoid all the idiotic decisions the people in the movies keep making, spend your time and money here.",Positive

1753,resident-evil-7-biohazard,TheHambro,"Apr 19, 2021",8,"The only two games I’ve played in this series were Code Veronica on the Dreamcast and Resident Evil 4 on the GameCube.  I don’t think I’ve ever finished them, so I never really developed the enthusiasm and interest for this series.  From what I can tell, future installments roughly followed the same formula and gameplay.  It seemed to become more outlandish with each new game, so I never cared to pick up another Resident Evil.  So, why did I pick this up?  It looked to deviate from its original philosophy and design, so I thought, yeah, what the heck, let’s give it a shot; and I’m glad I did. If I had to sum this game up in one word, I would say…..atmosphere.  The third-person perspective really accentuates the dread and tension surrounding you through the entire playthrough.  And to top it off, combat is close quarters: fighting enemies in narrow hallways or small rooms can be a nerve-racking experience.  I have two complaints here, and that’s the lack of enemy variety and length.  I clocked in around 16 hours, which is not bad, but I wanted more. Great game.  I’m glad I decided to pick it up.  Although I won’t say this game alone has rekindled my interest in the Resident Evil series, it at least has got me interested to pick up Village, and future installments should they follow this same formula.

1754,resident-evil-7-biohazard,TheTownDrunk,"Jan 25, 2021",3,"RESIDENT EVIL VII: BIOHAZARD goes first person and takes the worst of RESIDENT EVIL 2 & 3, which is recurring, scripted, unkillable villains. I hated Mr. X in RESIDENT EVIL 2 and Nemesis in RESIDENT EVIL 3, and here you get the Baker Family, a Texas Chainsaw-like redneck family.RESIDENT EVIL VII is not scary, often times you'll be laughing because it is ridiculous. It's just full of  predictable cheap jump scares and illogical BS, for instance you get your hand hacked off - no problem, just staple it back on, 2 minutes later it's as if nothing ever happened. Chainsaw wounds? No problem! Just eat an herb: insta-heal!Graphics are advertised as photo realistic - what a joke! Just look at the washed-out textures and you'll come to the conclusion that some games of 2015 look much better than this 2017 release! Then there's plenty of clipping errors - for scripted sequences!The playable character Ethan along with all the others are just bland stereotypes, especially the Texas Chainsaw family  - I mean the Baker family. Dialogues are just atrocious and make no sense (Ethan's girlfriend urging Ethan to come save her, but not to come. Huh?!).You get one horror cliche following a jump scare, followed by more cliches. I did enjoy RESIDENT EVIL 1 & 2 when they came out in the 1990s. The recent RESIDENT EVIL 2 remake is pretty good with a mod that takes out the annoying Mr. X/Tyrant and gets rid of those horrible camera angles and the crappy aiming of the 90s games.

Böyle bir oyun için 8 saatin yeterli bir süre olduğunu düşünüyorum, ne çok kısa ne çok uzun. Hikayesinden biraz bahsedeyim, öncelikle bir karşılaştırma yapmak gerekirse Resident Evil 2 ve 3'ün yeniden yapımlarını da oynamış biri olarak bu oyunun 2 ve 3'ün yeniden yapımlarına göre çok daha iyi bir hikaye ve hikaye sunumuna sahip olduğunu söyleyebilirim. Hikayesi gerçekten sürükleyici ve karakterler de gayet akılda kalıcı ve güzel. Resident Evil 7 aynı zamanda dediğim gibi hikaye sunumu konusunda da oldukça iyi. Oyuna yılladır haber alamadığı karısından kendisine bir video gelmesi ile şaşkına dönen Ethan'In karısını bulmak için Dulvey, Louisiana'daki ıssız bir kulübeye gelmesi ile başlıyoruz. Baker ailesinden Jack'in gelip bizi bulması ile asıl hikayemiz başlıyor. Baker ailesi, bataklığın ortasındaki bir çiftlik evinde yaşayan mutantlardan oluşuyor. Kapının çalmasından faydalanarak kaçıyoruz. Biz kaçarken Jack genelde peşimizde oluyor, bazen aniden kapıdan çıkıp önümüzde beliriyor bazen ise duvarları kırıp önümüzü kesiyor. Jack'e ateş etsek de, yaksak da patlatsak da bir şey olmuyor ölümsüz olduğu için. Buradan kurtulabilmemiz için Baker ailesinin kızı Zoe bizimle iletişime geçiyor ve serum için gerekli parçaları toplayabilirsek buradan kaçabileceğimizi söylüyor. Böylece uzun bir süre serumun parçalarını edinmek için uğraşıyoruz. Nihayet parçaları aldığımızda Mia ve Zoe'nin Baker ailesinin oğlu Lucas tarafından yakalandığını öğreniyoruz. Bu sefer de Lucas'ın yakaladığı Mia ve Zoe'ye ulaşabilmek için çaba sarf ediyoruz. Sonunda onlara ulaşıyoruz ve tam serumu alacakken daha önceki kısımlarda testere ile kestiğimiz Jack'in devasa bir canavara dönüştüğünü görüyoruz ve burada bir Boss savaşı patlak veriyor, Boss savaşlarından daha sonra bahsedeceğim. Jack'i sersemlettikten sonra onu öldürebilmemiz için Zoe bize iki serumdan birini veriyor, serumu Jack'e uyguluyor ve onu öldürüyoruz. Ardından Zoe ve Mia'nın yanına gidiyoruz, elimizde sadece bir tane serum kalıyor. Ancak serum hem Mia'yı, hem de Zoe'yi iyileştirmek için lazım. Oyuncu burada isterse Zoe'yi, isterse Mia'yı iyileştirebiliyor, burada verilen karar doğrultusunda oyunun sonu değişiyor. Buradan sonra iyileştirdiğimiz kişiyle birlikte bota biniyoruz, fakat Eveline ismindeki mutant kız botumuza saldırıyor ve sonradan Eveline ile Mia'nın daha önce gemi ile birlikte buraya geldiğini, Mia'nın küçük Eveline'e ona annelik yapacağını söylediğini, bu yüzden de Eveline'in Mia'nın peşinde olduğunu öğreniyoruz. Ardından Ethan bir halüsinasyon görüyor, bu halüsinasyonda Baker'lardan Jack bizimle konuşuyor ve aslında kendisinin de ailesinin de katil ve mutant olmadığını Eveline'in kendilerinin DNA'sını bozarak onları birer katil mutanta dönüştürdüğünü söylüyor. Bu sahneden sonra zorunda olduğu için onları öldürmüş olsa da Ethan biraz pişman oluyor. Ardından burada kontrol Mia'ya geçiyor. Mia ile biraz oynadıktan sonra, daha önceden verdiğimiz karar doğrultusunda Mia'nın akıbeti belli oluyor ve kontrol tekrar Ethan'a geçiyor. Ethan olarak tekrardan oyunun başındaki çiftlik evine gidiyoruz, yaşadığımız olaylar gözümüzün önüne geliyor ve en sonunda bu evde Eveline'i yakalıyoruz. Ardından Eveline'in küçük bir kız olmadığını, Baker'ların evinde hep gördüğümüz, hiç konuşmayan ve sürekli hareketsiz bir şekilde sandalyede oturan yaşlı kadın olduğunu öğreniyoruz. Sonra oyunun Boss savaşı başlıyor ve kadın aynı Jack'e olduğu gibi devasa bir canavara dönüşüyor. Ethan canavarın işini bitiriyor ve oyun sonlanıyor. Hikaye böyleydi, oynanışa gelelim. Oyun, Resident Evil 2 ve 3'ün de yeninden yapımında kullanılan RE Engine'ı kullanıyor. Bu oyun motoru ilk defa bu oyunda kullanıldığı için oynanış dinamikleri ve vuruş hissiyatı 2 ve 3'teki kadar başarılı değil ancak yine de yeterli seviyede. Grafik olarak da oyun 2017 yılına göre güzel grafiklere sahip, bazı yerlerde kapamaların çözünürlüğünün düşük kalması hatasına rastlanılabiliyor, onu da ekleyeyim. Bu oyunun en zayıf kısmına gelelim, yani Boss savaşlarına. Oyunda doğru dürüst Boss savaşı yok, yalnızca 2 tane var ve zaten biri oyunun sonunda yaşanıyor, ayrıca ikisi de birbirinin aynısı ve sıkıcı. Boss savaşı konusu hayal kırıklığı olsa da oyunun atmosferi gayet iyi. FPS kamera açısı da oyunun atmosferine uygun olduğu için atmosferi hissetmek daha kolay oluyor. Sonuç olarak, Resident Evil 7 iyi bir Hayatta Kalma-Korku oyunu, bu türü sevenlere öneriyorum.",Positive
1760,resident-evil-7-biohazard,Filmanwalt,"Jan  3, 2021",9,"I played and streamed the game via gamepass on the PC (makes the horror setting more bearable for me: D) and it took a little over 9 hours for the passage on normal difficulty. First of all, for me a great representative in the horror genre. My last Resident Evil was part 4 and before that I hardly played a Resi (so the remakes are already waiting for me). story I liked it consistently, the whole story was very exciting and excitingly staged, even if it takes a while in the game to get the background explained. But the game gives you the feeling that something is completely wrong. The game has apparently (2?) Endings and are likely tied to a specific decision (I healed Mia). The representation of the individual family members in the sections of the house was an exciting structure for the entire escape from the house. Incidentally, I also really liked everything about the house. I found the part in the Ship a bit weaker, even if that provided the background mentioned and was therefore necessary. I found it really cool that a certain family member then got this outstanding meaning (it literally clicks at one point in time) and works as a bracket for me, even the sequence with the father towards the end was almost emotional. Atmosphere / graphics The game looks exactly as it should, great graphics, a harmonious setting and, in the most important places, attention to detail. The atmosphere in the house is characterized by the game of cat and mouse and the heart likes to beat a little faster here. I'm not that big of a horror genre player, I have no problem with movies, but Resident Evil 7 does it right for me. It does not focus on jumpscares or the like, but occupies one with such tension through the mood of the game, masterfully. This threatening atmosphere is joined by a brutality that has almost frightened me at one point or another. Only the point mentioned before (Ship) was weaker, especially at the beginning, as was the end part in theMine, here you were basically only thrown with transforms, real tension only arose from the background information. Gameplay The cat and mouse game mentioned was implemented perfectly, kept the tension constantly high and I really enjoyed being able to explore all parts of the house with increased progress (unfortunately I planned the whole time that I already had the crow key and thus one Missed door with a gun). The resource management was ok, I only like it to a certain extent, but it adds to the depth of the gameplay. You have to think about what things you are crafting, what exactly you need, etc. I found the inventory management more difficult and was overjoyed with every backpack found, unfortunately I had one or the other situation in which I had objects (just now unpacked), contrary to expectations, I needed and had to pick it up (at least these checkpoints are set acceptable). I liked the pistol and shotgun a lot, unfortunately I couldn't test the Magnum (I just found 1 round of ammunition). The grenade launcher was very helpful towards the end and made the final boss look pretty ridiculous. The final boss fight itself is also my biggest point of criticism, because it was quite slow and I had hoped for more resistance, the two puke-transformed ones shortly before the end were more problematic. Conclusion I haven't played a better horror game yet, but despite all that, Resi 7 isn't quite perfect for me. But deserves 9/10 ETHAAAAAN for me.",Positive
1761,resident-evil-7-biohazard,BeeSting1,"Jan  1, 2021",10,"Resident Evil returns to its survival horror roots. I really didn't like the direction Resident Evil was going starting from RE5. It increasingly becoming an action game rather than survival horror, which RE1 was ALL about. But RE7 takes things back to the first page, and amps it up. The plot pulls you in right at the opening. You're going to look for your long lost wife, who has been missing for 3 years. You know some horrific things have happened, and the game lets you slowly unravel it. The settings in the game contributes to a huge factor to the horror. The realism of the objects, environment, and lighting. It was all perfect. There were many places where I didn't even want to step foot in because it looked so creepy. Ammo conservation is actually important again. Not as strict as the PS1 Resident Evils, but you still had to look out for how much ammo you blow. I actually over conserved my ammo, and I had a crap ton by the end of the game. The level design and gameplay progression was golden. It was clear what items you needed next, and markings on the map indicated what doors needed opening, so needless backtracking wasn't necessary. The VHS flash forward system was also really cool. You play through the memories of people who have visited the house. These give you clues as to where items were located. It was a clever addition. Overall, the entire experience kept me at the edge of my seat. I'm really happy the series brought back it's survival horror roots. I hope Resident Evil keeps going in this direction.",Positive
1762,resident-evil-7-biohazard,Parrots,"Dec 31, 2020",9,"Resident Evil 7 was such a good experience I don't see why you shouldn't pick it up. Sure it's First Person view but that's not a bad thing. A camera view doesn't automatically make it a copy of another game.At it's core it still felt like a Resident Evil game just different from the rest.The story was fun, the gameplay felt cool and the enemies were nice. The environment fit survivor horror. People are mostly mad because they want bad camera angles again. Resident Evil 7 is a great game but it's not perfect. The part that ruins the game for me is the boat where it suddenly becomes a full action game now where as earlier I more about conserving ammo and resources.Resident Evil 7 was an experiment gone right and raises the idea of Capcom trying NEW THINGS as well as bringing back old ones too. For some reason some people don't like change... unless that idea is RE6, then we go backwards or change it immediately. This title is one of the few titles that brought Capcom back to the light and that's a great thing because they've been better than ever. The DLC on the other hand is not worth getting.

1767,resident-evil-7-biohazard,SilverOrlov,"Nov 11, 2020",8,"Yes, this is not a RE 0-6. And you know what? I am glad! I was wildly enraged by many stupid and uninteresting things of previous games that from that Japanese developers, which are not in RE7. However, this does not mean that the game is not devoid of its own bad moments.What I liked: Sounds are simple but correctly inserted in every single place of the game. Great graphics. Very strong and emotional intro with the spirit of ""old good horror movies""(A little bit wildly, but after intro it's not happening, so it was forgivable and immediately took the player by the psychological gills). Save-rooms(I understand that horror games implies the fear of death from every cockroach, but for such psychos there is a maximum level of difficulty, and for ordinary players who like such games, allowing them to save in such rooms is an excellent solution. Although the logic is silly that monsters cannot knock out a flimsy door and not kill the player). The plot is actually full of logical nonsense and absurdity, but overall it was interesting. If it were not for all sorts of clichés and outright stupidity for the sake of ""stretching the drama on the genital organ"" - it would be generally excellent storytelling. A lot of people complained that the horror gradually turned into an simple action by the end of the game, but it seemed to me normal, since according to the plot it was quite justified. Another complaint was about the too simple-looking last location. Like it was done carelessly. I beg your pardon, what should the mine look like? With paintings of Rembrandt and a bar-scene? What did you expected to see there?...And now, what I didn't like:1) Immortal stupid Slo-o-o-ow do-o-o-ors(Jesus! A crowd of monsters is chasing me, and the character seems to be examining every crack on the door while opening it).2) The animation of weapons and objects is very good, but the animation of hitting the enemy is terrible and fills cardboard. The aiming is worse the closer the enemy is.3) Very inconvenient inventory. At least on a PC.4) No dodges, For what the f*ck*ng block with your hands here? Every enemy can bite you. I used it only in the last 10 minutes of the game. The knife is useless piece of sh*t for boxes with lot. No one will forgive you picking himself with a knife.5) YOU CAN NOT MISS DIALOGUES. This is generally an extreme degree of stupidity: why the f*ck should I watch the same scenes and dialogues after every death. Again, all modern games have this ability.6) Of course every American family has a house with a morgue and clock and shadow puzzles.7) Many times you see a very soapy picture. But the optimization is very good.8) The cake puzzle is a scripted f*cking sh*t. You saw what what will be happening but you can't move because of the f*ng script. It is logically epic fail.9) The main character is totally unemotional. He is a simple type of human but does not react at all to all that insane gore, blood and horror in the house. Only once on the spider-woman he swore in the scripted moment only AFTER she ran away.10) I beg to anyone to enter already huge penalties for the using of stupid screamers in films and games. I am waiting that happy time when the authors will begin to make quality horror without using ""dumb loud screaming out from your back""?11) Playing all RE games I have already pissed of shooting sometimes 3 bullets and sometimes 100500 bullets to the head of any monster.12) Viscous control. Even for a non-commando character, he is moving like a slow snail. In the last games there was a running, but the developers, apparently, thought that they didn’t care about logic, the main thing was that the player was afraid of being caught up(It looks especially stupid in the last DLC, when Zoya barely crawls with a rope while what is happening in the bathroom).13) Speaking of DLC: I didn't like them at all. The ideas and stories in all but one were interesting, but realization is terrible. It seems that the creators of the game deliberately turned on the difficulty of the game-play and the stupidity of some moments, so that it would seem like some kind of challenge ...But NO! ...An old boxer grandpa, killing strong monsters with his bare hands, which can regenerate and kill special forces soldiers by themselves. What the f*ck is that?14) A suspicious person in a house with barbed wire, during the disappearance of people and a policeman tells ""What are you doing here, you're suspicious"" instead of calling for help in the beginning. The character is also stupid, instead of a normal explanation of the problem, ""I have been kidnapped"" starts to say ""you don't understand"" and ""give me a gun"". GIVE ME YOUR GUN?15) Anyone even doubted about the final boss? Which was very disappointing. 3 minutes of covering face with arms, and 3 minutes of shooting straight ahead? WHAT?!Despite all the criticism, I liked the game much more. This is definitely much better than the latest RE games.",Positive

1770,resident-evil-7-biohazard,dandalis,"Oct 26, 2020",7,"I'm not sure if i'm on board with the new direction Resident Evil is going starting with this 7th main entry, but i'd be disingenuous if i said that RE7 isnt a good game. The new to the series first person perspective works well for the most part, though it still comes off as weird because i've used to playing Resident Evil mostly from a 3rd person perspective, part from the classics, and grown accustomed to bonding myself with protagonists in 3 dimensions, where as i couldnt do the same with Ethan, with whom you play majority of the game. 3rd person perspective is the reason why Jill, Chris, Leon, Claire etc. are so popular, beloved and recognizeable, same cant be said about Ethan.Speaking of characters, i do not like their uncanny valley ''realistic'' looks, Mia especially is just...unpleasant looking. Not a fan in general with game developers desperetly chasing realism with their character designs, very few pull it off well, most come up with freaky, uncanny looking designs that will age poorly with time. Franchises that have relied on stylised or semi-realistic looking characters, like Resident Evil, should stick to their guns. And womens long hair physics in RE7 are some of the most laughable i've yet seen aswell. The overall character designs just come off as bland and boring due to the realism focus.And what in the hell did Capcom do to Chris Redfield in RE7 ? He nor looks, nor sounds, nor feels like anything Chris Refield should. When it comes to the horror aspect, RE7 delivers. The atmosphere was pulled off expertly, where ever you are across the bayou and Baker farm, the game doesnt stop delivering a moody atmosphere, an unsettling feeling and dread. Star of the setting easily was the Baker place, as it felt like a genuinenly lived in home and location. The latter part of the game that takes place in other locations, despite seeing many ''professional'' reviewers lambasting them, didnt fair that much worse either in my opinion, they offered different environments than that of Baker's and still managed to deliver unease and suspense. RE7's story managed to suprise me. While there were some questionable decisions made by the devs, such as the tired old trope of a binary choice option at a crucial narrative point in the game, which even doesnt matter later on once Capcom makes the canonical choice in a related DLC for the game, but all in all i enjoyed what the story had to offer quite a bit. From the outset the game makes Baker family look like these grotesque monsters whom you either cant wait to kill or get away from, but as the game progresses you start seeing them from a very different perspective and sympathising with them. One of the Baker home characters doesnt feel just right during the game, but during the final stint of the main story, the character gives you a very satisfying ''makes sense'' feeling that you always had about them, but couldnt put your finger on it. Coming back to realism that RE7 strives towards so much, at times the game doesnt know what it wants to be, either this more serious horror experience, or dark comedy, it's not a major botheration, but that conflicting nature can be weird and somewhat confusing at times. It took time to get used to the tanky and somewhat clunky controls of Ethan in first person, though i still didnt like them all that much by the end of the game, i realise it's a survival horror game first, action second, but damn Capcom, an average man should be a tad more athletic and agile than that. Gunplay felt adequate, shotgun especially had a satisfying kick to it and sound effects for the guns were done quite nicely, blasting the Mold in the head was one of the most satisfying parts of the gameplay. If there's anything that i wish was more robust then it would be the aim down sights zoom view, as you cant really aim down the actual sights, rather just extend the side way view aim of the firearms.The boss battles were fun, except for the one with Lucas, as it relied too much on good ole Capcom's ''shoot the orange bits'' trope and the area was a pain to navigate. And screw whoever came up with the spitting attack for big fat blob enemy type, as they can hit you even if you stand still behind solid objects, which didnt exactly feel like a intentional part of the game's design. The overall enemy variety didnt offer much in visual and mechanical variety, but regardless offered a decent challenge and were fun to fight against, except when the game overwhelms you with various enemy types at once. RE7 on PC comes with some graphical issues too. The HBAO+ option is broken, if enabled it introduces very annoying ghosting effect to shadows of environmental objects. Texture setting also is a mess. The quality of textures doesnt improve past Medium, but if you go past it anyway, the game introduces severe stuttering. There's moderate issues with texture streaming too, as they tend take their sweet time to fully load during gameplay.",Average

1774,resident-evil-7-biohazard,TitaniumDragon,"Sep 15, 2020",5,"Resident Evil 7 is a return to the horror genre from the survival action games that the previous three games had been. Presented in a first person perspective, you play as Ethan, a man who is trying to find his missing wife, who sent him a mysterious message, first telling him not to look for her, then where to find her. The game starts off very promising – the house is suitably creepy, and when you run into the Baker family for the first time, they’re proper horror game enemies. Completely impossible to kill, they are implacable and unstoppable, and all you can do is slow them down and then run and hide. Horrible things happen to the main character, and there is something fundamentally wrong with his wife, Mia. Zoe, who seems to be related to the Bakers in some way, helps you out over the phone, and the whole thing seems to be unfolding rather nicely, as you try to explore a house while being stalked by a man who can’t be stopped and can’t be killed. There are even boss fights against these enemies, where you use powerful environmental objects to seemingly cause them severe damage and even “kill” them, but just minutes later they pop back up again and start throwing you around. The problem is, the game has to move on, and after that point, the game stops really working. The reason for this is fairly simple – when you’re early on in the game, you are weak and helpless. The house is creepy, the enemies are implacable, and you don’t know what’s going on. The few “lesser” enemies you face are really tough to take down and take a ton of shots from the pistol to the head to kill. To finally break out of the house, you get a shotgun and you manage to take down one of the Bakers before you break out. The fight is suitably dramatic – after multiple prior encounters where no matter what you did, your foe kept on coming back, here, you can finally do a good number on him, and there isn’t the same sense that he’s just going to pop back up again. But at this point, the Bakers are no longer invulnerable, and you are better armed and can actually meaningfully fight back. And this pretty much makes the game fall apart, because now, you know what’s going to happen – you’re going to creep around for a bit, there’s going to be a boss fight, and you’re going to kill them, and then they’ll come back and you’ll kill them again. So what was originally a really cool horror game turns into a more action oriented game. The enemies are still not something you want to waste ammo on, but the fact that you know you CAN just take them down makes them feel a lot less menacing – something that stays until a brief section towards the end of the game, where you are temporarily disarmed again (well, sort of. It’s complicated). The feeling of helplessness is gone. Worse, after searching the first house, the next two areas just feel like rehashes, where you’re just going up against a different member of the Baker family. The third area does mix up the formula a bit, but it still ends up following the same structure, which makes the game feel too predictable, which undermines the horror. And frankly, the other two members of the Baker family just aren’t as good at being intimidating as Jack is. The result is something like letting air out of a balloon, as the game feels like it just gradually deflates, transitioning more and more into a FPS game as enemies become less and less of a threat – but it still feels a bit janky, because it was originally a horror game. All in all, by the end of it, I was armed to the gills and ready for anything, and while this served as a bit of catharsis, it ultimately felt like the game was too long even at only 10 hours in length. It doesn’t help that the protagonists of the game – Ethan and his wife, Mia – are frankly not very interesting characters. Ethan feels kind of generic, and often seems to be kind of useless, and Mia’s character is very vaguely defined for most of the game, until you get to nearly the end of it. And while Jack Baker is a cool foe, the other two members of the family aren’t as interesting, even if a late-game twist tries to fix that. So what are my overall feelings on this game? On the one hand, the start of the game was really good, and delivered the horror, “don’t get caught” feel very well. On the other hand, the game just kind of goes downhill after you escape the first “real” area of the game. So I’m not sure I can really recommend this. It was interesting to play through for a bit, but at the end, I wasn’t terribly invested.",Average

1781,resident-evil-7-biohazard,greenisgood,"Jul 30, 2020",6,"I am so conflicted with my experience once the credits rolled around. This game in concept as well as the First Person aspect was something I really like and the over all arching story works... But there were a lot of detractors on the execution side which keep this from Excellence. My score could also be due to my recent completion of RE 2 Remake and riding that high wanted to get a little more RE feels, but it was bittersweet. TL.DR - A better VR experience than any other on market, not the most essential RE experience in it's long history. Primarily I feel like in 2017 after RE 6 this game was highly appreciated and it's drawbacks were overlooked more so. But in the long run and now in 2019 after Capcom going back to basics this RE Title will be just another in the boom of FP Horror Sims like the Outlast series. Good Stuff first. The opening and the first few hours of the game... really good and was a refreshing blast. Marguerite and Jack were certainly the highest points this game ever reached. The Stealth aspects to the game were good considering I am not a lover of heavy stealth focused games; it felt well balanced between an RE experience and what they were attempting. The VFX still stand even 2 years and a 2019 RE remake later. Looks good on my mid level system and I am sure people with better hardware will have better visuals.Special mention/Hats off to the Sound design as this was beyond stellar; the groaning, the creaking, the sounds of footsteps in the Baker home kept me on edge even a few hours into my play through. The story unravels itself well enough to keep you intrigued.Most of the antagonists actually have better characterizations than our leading man and lady... Jack and Marguerite Baker were really unnerving in their actions Daddy Jack being really calm even when lit on fire and Marguerite being a neurotic whacko.The Mo Cap was also en pointe as it really added to the atmosphere. Now to the things that really got me on edge and not in a a good way.The controls,My Play through was severely curtailed with the slow speed at which the character responded to my action input. I would regularly double press my run button in an attempt to make Ethan move faster only to realize he was already at top speed.This majorly annoyed me during the boss battles since it felt as if Ethan's run speed was intentionally throttled a bit more than his usual slow crawl just for an added level of tension especially since most of the boss battles you are in a confined section. This is lazy personally speaking; since nerfing over innovative mechanics is always a bad deal.Even the combat felt a bit more linear to most of the RE games I have played as the usually excellent RE weapon based combat fluidity was very weak.Certain weapons like the flame thrower was nearly useless outside of the Marguerite section as the mold enemies would regularly just charge through being lit on fire, even though the enemies were primarily mold based and it should have been one of; if not the most effective weapon. The healing mechanic was another one that really drove me insane.Ethan would spend near to a second admiring his friggin hand after pouring the healing potion along with slowing down his movement. This during boss fights especially and during mob skirmishes meant that while you were healing yourself you are already getting caught up in the next enemy attack; thereby taking damage immediately as you complete the 1.5 second heal or more infuriatingly completely cancel your healing animation probably killing you.In an RE game, hell in any Shooter be it action or horror this is a horrible design decision. No knife or Grenade sub command was another baffling decision. As for the Enemy Designs there was more bad than good... Other than Ma & Pa Baker every other enemy was just a moving mass of black mold; it got boring really soon since after the Marguerite boss fight they were the only enemies appearing in the world.We were in a giant swamp I'm sure the mold could be used to make better and imaginative enemies other than just size variation/bullet sponges.Lucas was the second weakest link in my play through as his whole section marked the beginning of a loss of momentum for me, the third Jack battle, the ship section all felt like artificial lengthening to the over all campaign.Even the Video Tape sections as a whole were really grinding; it only served to be a huge immersion breaker for me especially during the first few hours completely dissipating any dread built before watching/playing one of these fairly lengthy tapes. The game is not the best RE ever, nor it is worthy of zeroes, two's or three's; but it is not the best in the RE series.. Experience it only of you just want to enjoy a good VR experience or just for the sake of a different RE experience. Not a must play at all in my opinion.",Average

Lots a of scripted interactions to instigate the family, which results in characters popping out right in front of you, despite you knowing exactly where they were located. There are a few puzzles littered around, but they take moments to solve.

Not ""bad"", but it's certainly not good. It got a lot of rave reviews, but i'm really not sure why. Maybe it's a better experience in VR...who knows?",Average

The game really got me hooked :) I've been avoiding this one for nearly 2 years since purchase, but now that I've got more experience with Resident Evil series, I decided to give it a go. RE7 feels to me like Capcom wanted to combine all kinds of horror themes into one and strangely it all works together. Paying homage to its roots and pushing the once-beloved survival horror forward again was Capcom's goal, and in my eyes they nailed it. People who reviewed and criticised its lack of connection to the RE franchise and no recurring characters have not finished the game. The last fourth or so is like Resident Evil 4/5 on steroids (quite literally) and it's a blast. But I also enjoyed slower pace of the first half, which is more like Outlast than your traditional RE. Anyhow, finished the game, loved it, will definitely play it again a couple times, 10/10.

Resident Evil: Bio-hazard was a product of this pinnacle year. In late 2016, Resident Evil: Bio-hazard the demo had come out on Steam with a bang at an averaging half hour experience that brings us to a camera perspective of a journey through a desolate house at nighttime. This demo brought players to their knees, instilling fear in the community of PC and console gamers. However, when it was leaked that the game would be released January of 2017, I couldn't contain my excitement for this new installment in the Resident Evil Franchise. As Resident Evil: Bio-hazard came underway, players and speculators were horrified. This game started out with a cinematic scene of the main character’s exposition of why our main character, Ethan, will be going down into Dulvey, Louisiana after the cryptic message only moments ago from our presumed wife, Mia. Resident Evil as a franchise has proven to have its ups and downs, with Resident Evil 6, the predecessor to Resident Evil: Bio-hazard, being considered one of the worst games in the existence of the Resident Evil timeline. Resident Evil: Bio-hazard had shown to be the complete opposite versus its older counterpart. This game had brought hope back to the old Resident Evil fans as a collective group, and horror fans alike. Resident Evil: Bio-hazard brought back what controversial game Resident Evil 5 and poorly rated Resident Evil 6 had taken away.

1801,resident-evil-7-biohazard,K0ma,"Oct  7, 2019",6,"A decent horror game which looks nothing like Resident evil and feels as well as plays similarly, nothing like RE and more like Outlast. The story begins promising but turns into abysmal nonsense with suspicious similarities to F.E.A.Rs story. The influence from Outlast is ever present I'm not exaggerating it, it plays like Outlast with guns which is great, this game proves that Outlast should have guns.Its a weird not very RE sense of horror, less dependent on what made RE horror great and more on Outlasts based psychological, gore based horror which just doesn't fit for RE. Outlast and Silent Hill have much starker tones that are much darker than RE therefore it feels ""tryhard"" dramatic to me. The difficulty was meh, enemies are pretty weak if you land headshots and spawn in very predictable places, they cannot open doors so your safe near a doorway this is barely an exploit and more a poor game mechanic. Again the ""boss fights"" play like Outlasts main antagonists except you have weapons, without spoiling anything they're ok to inferior DOOM and yeah you can start to see the tonal dissonance here you have ""boss fights"", this isn't DOOM this is a super serious horror game where you save your wife. The puzzles are relatively easy but there's next to none compared to previous RE titles so they're nearly non-existent. The game play mechanics of run and hide and even level design as well as lighting all echo the design of Outlast but its still a pretty good game overall with smooth controls and decent combat rewarding accuracy with headshots I never had a problem with low ammo. The story is absolute nonsense and the massive lack of originality makes this game in no way related to the RE franchise. Its not worth the full price but on a 30-50% special definitely, the graphics alone are beautiful and warrant its purchase in part. Its an absolute far cry from P.T and Silent Hills atmosphere, more a very unusual ""Japanesey"" Outlast with a mediocre,  downright cartoonish story that's unintentionally hilarious at times due to this tonal dissonance. Overall I still enjoyed it though, I just wish it wasn't attached with the label RE and had some trace of originality to bolster it. It could stand alone as its own goofy title like Deadly Premonition.",Average

1820,resident-evil-7-biohazard,ScaryGargoyle,"Nov  6, 2018",6,"At first I was cautiously optimistic about RE7, as I try to be with all games. Quickly that optimism gave way to frustration, the cause of which I will explain in the following three paragraphs. I forced myself to push through that frustration, though, and in hindsight I'm glad I did. By the final third the game had won me over. Without further ado, here is what my journey through Resident Evil 7 was like: Most of the combat in the first several hours involved boss characters, specifically the various members of the family inhabiting the series of buildings in which the beginning part was set. I did not enjoy these parts of the game. You see, in RE7 the main antagonists are somehow able to reassemble themselves after serious injuries. I mean extreme mutilation and loss of limb, not just mere bullet wounds or broken bones.  It was frustrating for me to think I had defeated a boss only for them to return later, even more powerful than they were before. I nearly lost all patience with the second boss  who required an obscene amount of firepower to defeat. I swear I unloaded four or five tanks of flamethrower fuel, multiple shotgun shells and 44 magnum rounds, everything I brought with me PLUS what I could find in the area where the battle took place. Still, this was not enough. I ended up having to go back to an earlier area and unlock the grenade launcher, which enabled me to deal sufficient damage and overcome that boss. In addition, the early parts of RE7 did not run very well on my system. With a GTX 970, 16GB RAM and an i5 4690k I should not have experienced frequent drops in the framerate, especially considering I had several settings either turned off or set to low. However, later parts performed much better, probably due to the fact that the environment became darker, less intricately detailed, and more confined. It wasn't just the performance that improved after about 7 hours. I also found the gameplay and story much more enjoyable. RE7 really found it's footing in the final third, starting with the boat section and up to the ending. I felt that on the boat I was experiencing high quality survival horror gameplay. The game gave me just enough resources to squeak my way through and required a good deal of planning before making my next move. Eventually I found a machine gun and remote bombs and got to feel powerful for a little while before that part of the game came to an end. My only complaint regarding the boat section is that it was arguably the least visually interesting of all the environments RE7 offered. I would describe the rest of RE7 as competent and generally enjoyable. After the boat there was a brief section in a mine which lasted only for about an hour. I don't have much to say about that part except that it had some intense moments of combat with multiple enemies attacking at once. The final part of RE7 was even shorter than the mine. There was no combat outside of the final boss battle, which I did not find very compelling. First I had to chase them back and forth across the game's beginning stage, a rather tedious affair. Once I finally confronted them I only had to shoot them in the face a dozen times or so and that was all. I only died once and felt very little satisfaction when I defeated them. There was a nice little plot twist involving this final boss, though, so at least it had that going for it. To quickly conclude my review I will say that RE7 certainly had its moments of well-executed survival horror and is in my opinion the best game in the main series since 4. It's unfortunate that it took several hours to get to those moments, and that most of them occured in the most visually boring setting of the entire game. If you're willing to look past the flaws I've pointed out then this game could be worth giving a chance, especially if you can get it on sale like I did.",Average

1833,resident-evil-7-biohazard,BigBossManXXXX,"Oct 12, 2017",9,"Long time since i've written a review here but this game deserves one, and an honest one to be more pricise!In short, this game is a new way to experience Resident Evil so it was to be expected that many fans would resent the old style being changed. However changes can in some cases still be very good in order to give players new ways of interacting with the story. The good thing about this story is that you don't need to know the previous stories which have been told since Resident Evil 1. The gameplay has been fully made first person and the story has been written in chapters that will be done seperately throughout the entire game. The game takes approximately 4 hours (speed run) to complete, however you can easily double that amount and then some if you really want to find and do everything in it. The graphics are good (nothing fancy) however there are reports about stutter around the dining table scene but that can be helped by turning off certain shader options within your graphical program (it works better than ingame settings impo). Truth be told, i've not seen any stutter like mentioned above in my current 16 hours of playtime. It does however affect your overal fps quite a bit if you max out all your settings without paying close attention to the pros & cons that might come with it so keep that in mind or it'll ruin your experience as i've read on Steam plenty of times over. Also if you don't like backtracking, this game might not be to your liking because you'll have to do plenty of that as well! The pacing is not that fast, even when running so don't be upset about the way the story goes and the time you need to travel on foot..The inventory can and will luckily be increased depending on what you've discovered throughout the game, so you will in fact have the largest inventory available to you if you compare it with the inventories of previous Resident Evil games. There are plenty of tools for crafting, upgrading, and reforging. You will have herbs, pills, heath potions and many other stuff at your disposal. Weapons are varied, but not in large numbers so use them wisely. Difficulty wise there are a few modes in the beginning of the game, but you can adjust them additionally after completing the game if you want to challenge your skills even further.This review will not go into every detail because i don't want to spoil too many things, and i don't want to mention about the characters or the initial story for that matter. Personally i think it's better to be oblivious about the game and get into it without expecting too much at first. Just keep an open mind and take it from there. What else can i say? Well, would i rate 10/10? Hmm, honestly it deserves at least 8.5/10 and i'm also happily giving a GOTY reward in it's own class. However i already put 16 hours into it after 2 days, i must say that doesn't happen all too often these days, so i will rate this game a solid 9/10!Don't take my word for it guys, but try it out for yourselves okay. Just make sure you are in the clear of running this game optimized, so do your homework or better yet make sure your rig is well optimized before playing.. Have fun!",Positive
1834,resident-evil-7-biohazard,Dannystaples,"Sep 25, 2017",6,"I recommend this game BUT I was VERY close to not recommending it. I am totally divided by this game. I don't really care about the new direction. They wanted a change they decided on first person. That is fine. The visuals were great, it ran well enough on my GTX 1070 and i5 6400, that I could run it at 60fps, 1440p with everything on max except AA and then I even bumped the resolution scaling up a couple of notches as well. So it runs very well indeed. I enjoyed the throw backs to the original Resi games. Although I think some were a little TOO familiar. Swapping a shotgun with a broken one for example. Stupid and lacking creativity. It was also WAY too easy. Not combat wise that was fine but puzzle wise it was kind of pathetic. Basically didn't need a brain to play this. Never once did I even need to think about a puzzle. You find something that you need and more often than not you will be handed that exact thing not a minute later. Which boils it down to a straight action game for the most part. Story wise it was okay. I do like that they are trying to tie it into the main franchise. I personally loved the originals and while it will never match the T-virus Racoon City story arches trying to get it in there somewhere is fine by me. What I didn't really like was The Bakers and Eveline. I just think the entire premise is crap. The stupid sludge enemies are lame. Didn't scare me in the slightest. In the originals you had the T-virus which was applied in LOADS of different ways. It spawned grey heads, crimson heads, dogs, spiders, crows, lickers, giant plants, sharks, Tyrant, Nemesis. In this game you have a few red necks, a little girl that voms black stuff and a load of black blobs. So unimaginative!!!! And speaking of not scaring people. This game's ONLY scare mechanic is jump scares which makes me feel like they are totally out of ideas already. Jump scares stopped being scary about 10 years ago. EVERYONE jumps at jump scares it is evolutionary. It is also a cliche and out of date. Move on and do something different. The dialogue in this game is f***ing terrible. This ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ chases his lost girlfriend right into the middle of a swamp and NOT once did he really ask why. It was like he is a puppet. Being pushed along by the player. Never really questioning why anything is the way it is. He's pathetic. That part with the police officer OMFG!! Some of the most pointless lines ever spoken in a game. That part was just totally unnecessary and boring. Really not a fan of the respawning enemies as well. Smash a guy's head in with a car and some girders and he just comes back again. BORING!! Also having it in first person and this guy's total lack of any human features makes it nearly impossible to give a single shred of a f**k about what happens to him. He could have died at the end and I wouldn't have cared. He just doesn't act HUMAN! No one would act like he does in this game. Also that stupid ""choice"" they give you between saving Zoe or.......(I've actually forgotten her name that is how forgettable she was) the other one. I've never been given a choice in a game I've cared SO LITTLE ABOUT. He should have left them both there. At least then they'd have some company. It was all just so forgettable. So uninteresting. TOTALLY overhyped. The best standout moment for me was the young guy's mazes/puzzles. With the birthday cake. THAT was pretty good. I enjoyed that. But everything else I was just going through the motions. There are also some really crappy things like at the end when you are flying away on the helicopter and there is emotional classical music playing. It is totally out of place. There was nothing epic about that ending. Like I said I felt nothing for the c**t you played as and I honestly was kind of glad it was over. Some of the creepy Marylin Manson music from the movies would have gone down a lot better. I don't know I just honestly don't think I'll remember much about this game in a few weeks. It's already starting to fade. I actually needed to force myself to keep playing it at some points. I turned it off for bed and then didn't touch it again for a few days. This is far from the worst game ever but it is a LONG way from the best games. It is a LONG way from the originals as well. It's worth playing but not remembering.",Average

1836,resident-evil-7-biohazard,faccioone,"Jul 16, 2017",9,"I usually write reviews to complain of an especially bad title, but this time I'm doing this out of awe.Resident Evil 7 is possibly the best resident evil, and for me the best survival horror of the last 12 years. GAMEPLAYJust awesome, the first person camera is more than perfect, combat system is ok, weapons are all very satisfying if used in the right context, and there's lot of hidden valuables so to make the exploration of every room a pleasurable ritual. This game is very much scripted, in the old RE fashion, only allowing for a few actual free choices overall. This could sound awful but it is not. Any single room, corridor, sequence or event is little challenge. It doesn't get boring, as it is built this way to make you feel constantly challenged and on edge. You're in for a surprise at every turn. GRAPHIC AND AUDIOThe RE engine is a piece of art in my humble opinion, and I love it especially for its astounding light effects. In a survival horror, nothing is more important than that, and I seriously never have seen like this before. The audio effects are fantastic in never allowing your anxiety level to go down, apart from few secure areas.The overall experience feels like living a perfectly paced movie PLOTAlthough the plot may at first seem disconnected from any other RE, those who care to put informations together may find references from previous games, events and characters, and hints to **** yet to happen. I myself, haven't played only half the titles in this franchise (RE 2,4,5),  am unable to connect certain dots. Also the finale is mindblowing for more than one reason, as I found out on my second runthrough in Madhouse mode. I suspect I could even find out more playing it a 3rd time, but I restrained myself from doing that.Cutscenes can't be skipped but are superbly executed, as is the voice-over. The level of polishing for so many details is simply astonishing. I give this 9 and not 10 for some minor shortcomings:- enemies are few in kind and not very scary-looking, apart from this they do an excellent job of giving you heart-attacks- can't aim down the barrel- some items are just useless",Positive

On the second playtrough at ""madhouse"" difficulty, all items and enemies are on different places, but its not nearly the same atmosphere as the first playtrough. Also you recoginze on your second playtrough how scripted everything is.Besides that, all enemies disappear, if you enter the safe rooms, or walk the stairs up the cellar and this is like a cheat you can use at any time and safe a lot of bullets.

El título tiene más relación con la saga Resident Evil que lo que pueda parecer en un primer momento, además de los guiños que tiene a la misma y a películas del género (La Matanza de Texas, El Motel del Infierno, etc). Gráficamente es bastante fotorealista y en alto/muy alto se disfruta mucho (visualmente hablando). Claramente lo he jugado en PC, no puedo opinar con respecto las versiones de consola. Por último, en cuanto a la duración del mismo, a mi me ha durado en ""normal"" (en una primer vuelta no puedes elegir la dificultad más elevada, si no que se te desbloquea al terminar la primera vez) exactamente 9 horas y 31 minutos, osea que no está mal para un videojuego de estas características...

1849,resident-evil-7-biohazard,chusa19965656,"Mar 30, 2017",9,"Debo admitir que no confiaba en el juego debido a los grandes cambios que se le habían hecho con respecto a otras entregas pero me ha sorprendido gratamente haberme encontrado con un DIGNO merecedor de llamarse Resident Evil y entrar en la saga principal y no como un simple Spin Off. Tiene todos los elementos de la saga, comenzando con el más básico de todos: la ambientación del juego en general acompañada con una banda sonora, si bien no magnífica, acorde a lo que sucede en torno al título. En ningún momento pude sentirme relajado, a pesar de que no hubiese nadie en la misma habitación donde me encontraba y no sentía eso desde los primeros juegos (compréndase RE 0, 1, 2 y 3). Si bien el juego no destaca por su historia, allí está y está bien lograda, exceptuando algunos casos pero dentro de todo está bien. Otro elemento clásico de la saga, también presente en este título es la existencia de una corporación ""X"" que desarrolla un virus y que planea utilizarlo como armamento militar, esto deriva en la creación de las conocidas B.O.W (aunque no son zombies, hay BioArmas y eso es lo importante) que, a pesar de ser un único tipo y no haber muchas variantes entre estas, están introducidas correctamente en el juego. La gestión clásica del inventario hace presencia nuevamente para ponerlos en situaciones de peligro la mayoría de las veces. Tenemos que ser muy cuidadosos con lo que guardamos en el inventario ya que contaremos con un espacio reducido para guardar objetos (aunque no tan reducido como los primeros juegos) y posteriormente podremos aumentar esos espacios dándonos un abanico de posibilidades dentro del inventario como pasaba por ejemplo con Resident Evil 4. Los jefes y enemigos están puestos en lugares específicos dispuestos a hacerte la vida imposible y no siempre podrás usar la fuerza bruta con ellos yendo con tus armas dispuesto a disparar sino que en ocasiones tendrás que pensar un poco y evadir el peligro. Las armas y los objetos que están dispersados a lo largo y ancho del mapa también son algo que destacar, hay variedad de armas y todas son obtenibles para usar en el momento que uno quiera, pero claro, tendrás que administrar tus recursos y a veces dejar algún arma para conservar otra y para eso están los clásicos Baúles, que nos permiten alojar objetos en él con la intención de liberar espacio en nuestro inventario pero sin perder el objeto en cuestión (ya que al descartar un objeto ya no puede recuperarse). Las balas, los elementos de curación y otros objetos varios serán de vital importancia para el desarrollo del juego. Si bien no escasean las balas, tampoco abundan, es como un balance bien logrado entre los primeros juegos y los últimos, quedándose en el medio en lo que a munición se refiere. Cuando nos sobren las balas podremos estar tranquilos y darnos el lujo de gastarlas porque aparecerán más, cuando estamos con la cantidad justa de balas, lo más conveniente es hacer que cada disparo cuente. Todos estos, entre otros, hacen de este título un digno merecedor del nombre y del legado de la saga. Si hay detalles a mencionar que no están buenos, como por ejemplo que hay un momento en particular donde la historia da un giro radical y cambia todo lo que conocíamos y eso se siente bastante forzado, también el hecho de que para los gráficos que tiene no es un juego que valga la pena por 60 dólares y el hecho más molesto del juego es que los dlc que vienen en el season pass no vengan incluidos en el juego, si bien el juego no depende de estos dlcs porque el juego SI está completo, hubiera sido bueno que los dlcs los incluyeran en la versión final y no tener que pagar 30 dólares más por el Season Pass solo por 3 dlcs que no aportan gran cosa a lo visto anteriormente, en este sentido creo que el golpe de efecto lo dará el dlc gratuito ""Not a Hero"" ya que presume continuar lo que sería la historia principal comenzando desde el final del juego mismo (hablaré de él cuando salga y del 3er dlc del Season Pass también). Y por último, pero no menos importante... Es un juego muy corto para personas acostumbradas al género. Que quiero decir con esto? una persona promedio, que no juega demasiado este tipo de juegos, puede demorar entre 8 y 13 horas en terminarlo, lo cual es un tiempo bastante decente para un título como este. Pero si por el contrario, ya se tiene experiencia en juegos así, entonces perfectamente el juego se puede terminar en 4 horas o menos dando por resultado un juego corto para usuarios experimentados en el género, hubiera estado mejor si hubiera sido más largo, pero creo que está bastante bien. En un todo el juego está muy bien pero esos puntos hacen que mi calificación no sea perfecta. Quiero destacar que este Análisis lo hago después de haber pasado el juego en las 3 dificultades disponibles, además de haber jugado los 2 dlcs salidos al día de hoy que son Banned Footage Vol 1 y Banned Footage Vol2.",Positive

The evil within tried this but it ultimately failed. I have not tried this in VR but If i did im sure I would of pooped my pants a few times. This isn't a flawless game tho, It does have its issues.

1855,resident-evil-7-biohazard,Enigmonkey,"Mar 14, 2017",8,"I came here expecting the reviews to be 8-9-10, not 0-2. The game is atmospheric, well designed, and enjoyable from start to end. It's just maybe not the type of game that others quoting nemesis and silent hill would have liked to have played It didn't have the sheer terror factor that say, Silent Hill Shattered Memories had on me, with faceless goons chasing you through seemingly endless labyrinths. This is more of an acceptable, typical exploration, loot, and escape game. I don't think there was ever a point where I didn't want to go forward because I was too afraid, it keeps the scares tame, and the action and tension high. Gore plays a part, but it's well placed in a way to show you how savage the bakers are, and to establish exactly what will happen when they catch you. The scares don't come from Jump Scares and extreme gore, as many others have said, but actually from nuanced sound effects, and the unexpected placement of the baker family. You never know when you turn a corner whether you're going to meet Mad Jack, the invulnerable farm-dad with his big old pitchfork, or Marguerite, the lantern carrying cockroach vomiting bug woman, or your psycho ass girlfriend. You'll be creeping along hoping none of the baker's hear you, when the floorboards will creak, or a window will rattle at you. Most of the time, but not always, it's nothing but the wind, but it keeps you on edge regardless. The plot feels like it could have used more work, given as the majority of it is explained in a number of books near the end of the game, instead of learned throughout. Some characters, such as Zoe, also feel shoehorned in  just to give the player a purpose to ""go forward"". It's also inconsistent in it's storytelling, noting at one point that ""you can't cure them because the infection has been in them for too long"", while in the DLC you realise that the person who ""can"" be cured, was infected the very same day. Overall though, a lacking plot and Zoe aside, the game fluidly transitions from an alien isolation style escape game into a call of duty shooter, with the theme of the Evil Dead heavily worked in. It's a great play, and easy to stay engaged in from the very start to the very finish. Not a must-play, but certainly a good few hours of enjoyable house-escape nonsense.",Positive
1856,resident-evil-7-biohazard,KittyWhisky,"Mar 12, 2017",8,"Resident Evil 7 - a nice update of the series. The sixth part finally turned into a stupid action, revelations and revelations 2 was a good branches, and I enjoyed playing in them, waiting here. But resident evil has become monotonous and dull, to scare us long ceased. Resident Evil 7 was a new look to the series.Don't know whether it was necessary to attribute the number 7, because the game is not related to the series (behind small exceptions). The game could be the next spin-off, but Capcom decided to emphasize the importance of this game. Let's be honest - the first-person view, the developers certainly made for VR. Well, okay, the more the mansion is much nicer to explore in the first person: you can carefully examine all, and to literally feel yourself in the shoes of Ethan - graphics in this game are extremely good, and the VR effect of immersion increase, so the first person can be forgiven.Types of enemies are few, they are in essence 2 kinds: pleskavica and the Bakers, insects too, but they do not want for enemies to count. Plesnevyj 4 types: regular, long arm, blade, fast and puking. Diversity there are no enemies at all. Where are the least dogs? From the Bakers I liked Jack - it is a colorful boss, a real maniac. His wife me no problems at all, delivered, and location with it is extremely easy. Their son is even worse - shoot bombs and solve puzzles. Yes, in this game the enemies are not very specified. Many claim that zombies do not exist. Well, they are with us long gone. 4 parts were parasites, revelations 1-2 is also not a zombie.Puzzles... We all remember the demo beginning hour with the cassette and different puzzles. Nothing like that in the game there. Easier puzzles I have not seen. And magazines is very small, I thought they were going to play a big role, or will have to know the background (Yes, we just get previous events, but this is not enough).Resident Evil 7 not Outlast, we here give enough to shoot, and we hide only in the first third of the game. The last third of the fully action - it's not what you would expect. For me, the best part of the game - before leaving the house with three goals. Then not so scared for his life, although the atmosphere remains. It is a pity that the developers again decided that once the game is in first person, it is possible not to prescribe the main character, because the player will be easier with him associated. And we got a little emotional Ethan: cut off the hand, whatever, this every day; cut down leg - don't care; wife crazy - 4ack. Yeah, he's not the most silent, and sometimes says something, but not enough.Resident Evil 7 will make you survive, to scare would be, too, but mostly Boo moments. The game is very atmospheric, even when there are no enemies, you're still scared by different sounds, and the unknown dark passage ahead. The game keeps the tension, though by the end you will run and shoot all at times two. The game should have ended on the departure of Ethan with his wife (or her), or add more of the same frightening and atmospheric moments as before. But after the blame game don't want to, I want to go again the atmospheric part of the house. Recommend to beat the game is the best survival horror in recent years, soak up the atmosphere, slowly explore the house, this is not the same resident evil, but give him a chance.",Positive

1860,resident-evil-7-biohazard,FormerHuman,"Mar  5, 2017",6,"Resident Evil 7 gets off to a great, if hackneyed start, piling on atmosphere, gruesome details and a sense of vulnerability that unfortunately starts to give way once the combat becomes established, weapons and ammunition become increasingly plentiful (comically so in the third act, with the addition of a rapid fire weapon with hundreds of rounds just lying around). The game's strengths, if not in it's unremarkable writing (so far, so Resident Evil, in that regard) are in the sparsity but intensity of the encounters in the first half of the game, largely revolving around a few distinct characters (or at least two of them - with a tanker-ship sized plot hole simply leaving one antagonist floating somewhere in the ether, never to be discussed ever again). The relatively small variety of creatures to deal with, all of which are less than challenging to dispatch, are also fairly similar, and familiar, and after the initial shock encounters lead into repetitive headshot after headshot, the tension dissipates rapidly. Boss encounters are also a mixed bag, the first two being staggered and increasingly weird affairs, eventually becoming trad-Resident Evil Giant Monster Eye Target Practice. It's so badly in contrast with the claustrophobic, minimalist approach at the beginning of the game that it yanks you out of the experience. All this being said, though, I had fun, even if it wasn't as consistently thrilling and genuinely uncomfortable as Alien: Isolation. The first half of the game plays brilliantly, full of tension and every corner of the Baker residence is a curiosity, lovingly rendered in explicit, grimy, mouldy detail. The environmental design throughout is exceptional, bar for the closing chapters which revolve around bland metal corridors and caves. If this wasn't a Resident Evil franchise entry, however, I suspect the developers could have gone in more interesting directions, instead of falling back upon overly familiar tropes as fan service. More than once whilst playing, I reminisced on what Silent Hills could have been had Konami not taken the vexing and perverse decision to cancel it. Ultimately, the unlimited weirdness of Silent Hill, combined with Junji Ito imagery and Del Toro narrative flair, would have been a more truly unique game - Resident Evil 7 largely feels like a bag of horror cliches, better executed than most but beholden to a franchise known for poor writing and characterisation, that is getting increasingly long in the tooth.",Average

I usually run no AA for a crisp clear image- until they come up with an AA option that completely eliminates aliasing (8k monitor anyone?) I dont see the point in these rubbish blur filters that make it a little less aliased at the cost of clarity and detail.After messing with the resolution multiplier though, running at 1.9 times the resolution gave me a much cleaner image, and I was able to play through the game and found the gameplay quite enjoyable.If it had the option to turn off antialiasing and use a 104degree FOV i would have given it an 8/10.",Average

The game plays basically the same as the older ones with the setting and survival horror styled mechanics like saving your ammo, health and such, but unlike any other main entry in the series Resident Evil 7 is not played from fixed camera angles, but from first person. In my mind it doesn't really change the feel of the game in either way, but I understand if it shocks some hardcore fans like me. The story on the other hand isn't really all that great (well it's Resident Evil duhh) as it feels too similar to other games of the same gender. All in all the setting is good and the Bakers are a terrifying enemy, but that's just it cause the other enemies feel a bit overused and boring after a while.

The whole game seems to be deliberately cut in quantity, but upped in quality, which I think is a great direction.

Facts & arguments: + Survival-horror is actually back with a decent mix of action!+ Item management is back as well. You need to carefully decide on which items you should at certain points.+ The original level design (spooky mansions, underground passages, laboratories) and map interconnectivity (a very good one) is here.+ After a long time, the puzzles are back! There could be more of them, but I was happy with what I've encountered, as they seemed really logically placed.+ Story-line is still based on the same themes - bio viruses and secret organizations.+ Classic RE weapons are present, bosses are cool - especially Jack - a video game manifestation of T-1000. The last boss could've been better, but it did not ruin the game experience in any way.+ The enemies (despite the small variety) are challenging and terrifying, also the dismembering physics is a great add on.+ The game has a big replayability factor with different modes (and a free story DLC coming up in Spring). In my book it was RE 3: Nemesis as the last true RE game, afterwards the series lost it's appeal as a survival horror game. Though RE 4 was a good action game, it was a big departure gameplay/story wise from the main series and could've been titled as a spin-off (if RE 5 hadn't come out). Resident Evil 7 is a great comeback, a true sequel to longtime RE fans. It's very immersive, really fun, hard (on mad house difficulty), it uses classic RE formula, but enhances it with it's modern changes (great engine, first person view, a new twist in the story).

The atmosphere throughout was chilling and scary at times but not overly so, don't be put off if you consider yourself a bit of a wimp when it comes to horror titles (I do and I still loved it), I was also pleased that jump scares weren't overly used but when they were I definitely felt my heart rate speed up. I will mention one negative and that's VRAM usage, the game uses an absolutely absurd amount, you will need a 6GB GPU for high textures and a 8GB GPU for very high, leaving those of us with the ever popular GTX 970 with medium textures, now, this isn't as bad as it sounds as the texture quality setting doesn't actually affect the quality of the textures like in almost every other game, instead it affects texture caching, on medium you will see some rare texture pop-in whereas on higher settings you won't, the textures themselves are the same.

I have played Resident Evil games since the 90's and after Resident Evil 4 it all went downhill, but now it looks like it's returning to its original roots. In the story you are Ethan Winters, whose wife has been missing for 3 years and finally contacts him asking him to come and get her. The story feels strong at first but starts to feel weaker at the end because of lack of information.Basic enemies are slime monsters, and after awhile you will know when you can expect to see them. But the real enemy is Baker's family: Jack, Marguerite, and Lucas. All of them have unique fighting styles, which I'm not going to spoil. The whole story takes about  8-10 hours the first time, but it does have replay value. After finishing the story you feel like you've survived true horror.I recommend you play this on madhouse difficulty. Then it really feels like a classic Resident Evil game, because you have a limited amount of cassette tapes that you can use to save a game. And if you die you return to the last cassette player. Ammo and heal items are very limited. As a long time Resident Evil fan I'm happy to see that Capcom did a good job on this game. I just wish part of the story wouldn't be DLC, which ruins some of the experience.Overall the controls and the story are good, and it really feels like good old Resident Evil.

1898,resident-evil-7-biohazard,Langly,"Feb  1, 2017",10,"I have been playing the Resident Evil series since the first one launched in 1996 and absolutely love the games. I was a bit skeptic at first when i heard they made the switch to first person but also enthousiastic to hear they would bring the series back to it's roots with a focus on survival horror. So when i got the game i went in with an open mind and tempered expectations, but that very quickly changed into pure pleasure and immersion in the game. The story unfolds slowly and it's not till halfway trough the game you'll get that old ""Umbrella done messed up vibe"". But the story is fascinating and the atmosphere, although not horribly frightening, is just spot on. The gameplay is solid and the first person view works very well. You do get weapons and ammunition but unless you are fighting the weaker enemies you don't feel like they give you any sort of advantage. Shooting the bakers just pisses them off.The audio is very good and the voice acting is probably the best in the series so far. The graphics are decent, not amazing, but very well made to fit the setting and atmosphere of the game. And if you're lucky enough to have a pc that runs this on 4k 60fps and ultra settings you will get a rather great visual experience. Just be aware that this requires a machine way more powerfull than the recommended specs. So in the end this game has been worth every penny so far. I've put 40 hours into it on my first week and there will be plenty of both free and paid DLC to come. So if you're a fan of the early games you'll love this, if you like survival horror and want a well worked out game with good story and lots of lore to find, you'll have a great time. If most of your time is spent in games like CoD or WoW or any of the mainly multiplayer focussed games you may not like this as much.This is a story rich game with alot of exploration and solving puzzles.

So I will get straight to pros and cons: Pros:- detailed environments- nostalgic- can be climatic, but sadly inconsistently- well calculated resources, so you need use it efficiently- feels catching enough despite many cons. Cons:- disjointed gameplay, half of the game is hide and seek puzzle solving, second half is COD shooter- disjointed storyline that feels written in 10 minutes while doing a thing in a toilet.- poorly developed and poorly presented characters- excessive backtracking and re-use of content with video tapes.- graphics from technical standpoint feel underwhelming (poor textures, bad anti-aliasing solutions, inconsistent lighting)- personally, I didn't feel any horror and didn't found enough tension I was looking for.- lazy enemy design and extremely few enemy types",Average
1901,resident-evil-7-biohazard,Avadon,"Feb  1, 2017",3,"3 hours was all I could stomach from RE7. After 3 hours of crawling around a Scary House™, looking for keys like it's 1998, dealing with horrendous laggy shooting controls combined with such severe ammo shortage that if you miss a couple of shots you might as well reload and lose 20 minutes of progress... being chased by the same immortal hillbilly grandpa over and over again and ""bossfighting"" him over and over again until in the last fight he charges me with a powertool, glitches through a stone pillar and 3-shot-stunlocks me until I die 5 times in a row, I'm done. Why keep playing this? For the archaic gameplay? For the repetitive bossfights with glitchy ""mechanics""? (Oh I'm sure I'd get to fight hillbilly grandma too later on, does she go ""YEEHAWWW AMA GIT YOU SON"" while she's chasing you as well? Terrific). For the horror? There is no horror. Have you seen Texas Chainsaw Massacre? Good, now watch it again. How scared do you feel the 5th time you watch it? This is how scary this game is, because everything feels like a copy of a copy of a reference to a western horror b-movie. Repetitive, boring and annoying as hell to play. Stay away.",Negative
1902,resident-evil-7-biohazard,Johnlucash,"Jan 31, 2017",9,"As a longtime Resident Evil fan and one that appreciates Resident Evil 1 remake and Resident Evil 2 the most not to mention Resident Evil 4 was awesome in it's own right but different, I do not understand how any person could give this game less then a six or seven  and that is someone that doesn't appreciate Resident Evil genre or a good horror game in general. From experience it seems there's always people out there to slam games or give them a perfect 10 just to offset the medium. But I wanted to write a review directed at true RE fans and those who appreciate a good single player game. Do not listen to the people who gave this gaming review of zero or just flat-out hated on it, I understand some people don't enjoy the games as much as others but if you like Resident Evil and like a good horror and survival game you will not be disappointed. Something this game had that the others didn't was the aspect of someone following you around the house with more intelligence then a zombie who might break down a door once in awhile but stays the exact same hallway for the rest of the game. This game is much different then some of the Resident Evil titles but I would recommend this as a bye to anyone who appreciates the genre. Ensure any game can have someone speed run through it and beat it in a couple hours but the atmosphere and the richness of the environment made this supposed 10 to 12 hour game last almost 20 for me. I know others will say different about the time but I was almost hesitant to buy this game after seeing some of the negative reviews on Metacritic and I'm very glad I didn't listen to them. This game may not be a 10 but easily an 8 or 9.",Positive

The graphics are great but not cry-engine insane. The differences between watching a video of the game and playing the actual game are insane. The slight delay in your flashlight following your field of view makes it scary, the lighting makes it scary, the whole gloomy vibe makes it scary, The voices are great, the ""Kinda RPG"" system is great (finding, managing and crafting items), Experiencing the video logs yourself makes the game even more enjoyable. I don't like games with a short story line and i had 3 moments in the game i thought i already finished it, but there was more and more and more to the story and that really surprised me. I was really skeptical about this game but it exceeded all my expectations. I've played: Silent Hill series, Resident Evil series, Evil Within and F.E.A.R series.",Positive

1905,resident-evil-7-biohazard,Reginthorn,"Jan 31, 2017",9,"Resident Evil 7 is one of the most enjoyable horror gaming experiences to date. The visual jump scares seldom feel cheap in part due to the masterful sound design. Making people jump isn’t a difficult task. However, making people terrified to progress the plot is a daunting task to pull off. Resident Evil 7 absolutely succeeds in pulling off what developer/publisher Capcom set out to accomplish. After the failure of RE6, the need for the series to return to the survival horror genre became clear. Horror is all about maintaining an atmosphere. Walking down a corridor, Ethan Winter (the surrogate for the player) might hear some variety of crash off in the next room or in the room above. The mansion is lived in (a slightly inaccurate phrase) and a sense of foreboding never escapes the player except for around the ending. The sound design mixed in with phenomenal limited lighting merge in encouraging the player never be overconfident in a given environment. Unlike previous entries, the locations are realistically scaled down. The Baker homestead never features a room or ground that feels out of place. In other words, the property is very much one might find in reality. Conversely, the game’s need to feature a puzzle at every turn suspends belief every once in awhile. In the end, the limited environmental scope aids in augmenting the horror. The developers painstakingly created the home to a disturbing degree. Every nook and cranny of the home serve a purpose in telling the Baker family’s story. The player is rewarded at great cost for exploring the environment. In addition, the exploration feeds into a very enjoyable item management system. All of the items encountered are useful. In order to make backpack space, the player has to really decide what is the most useful item in a given situation. Looking through your inventory doesn’t stop the game time. You could be looking at the very low ammo of a given gun and suddenly come under attack. In most fights, the best solution is often to run away until a more advantageous moment. The narrative lasts little more than ten hours. The duration of the experience ensures the plot never drags or overstays its welcome. The mysteries of the circumstances surrounding Ethan Walker are more than enough to ensure the player fights their fear. The player won’t be able to stop themselves from enjoying their twisted adventure with the Baker family. The PC version is optimized.",Positive
1906,resident-evil-7-biohazard,gmanxp,"Jan 31, 2017",7,"Game itself is good, however I encountered some issues with the PC version. Let me explain: I had initially planned to play the game with a gamepad on my 4K TV, however this is when issues started. For whatever reason, I was unable to set the game to operate at 60 hz when I set the resolution to 4K. In fact, on my TV, I wasn't able to set it at anything above 30 hz unless I set the resolution down to 1080p. So, I look online and find that other people are having this issue, however there is no definitive way to fix this issue. (And before people ask, my GTX 1080 can handle 4K 60 hz no problem, and my HDMI cable was fine according to Nvidia Control Panel.) So, after my initial frustrations, I decided to play the game on my 1440p Gsync monitor. Luckily, the game was able to detect 144 hz at 1440p. (I have a feeling that this game just prefers Display Port cables for anything above 1080p 60 hz. But seeing as my TV doesn't have a Display Port connection and an adapter would require me to completely change my sound setup on my TV for the game, that's not going to happen either.) When playing on my monitor, I prefer to use a keyboard and mouse over a gamepad, which is when the next issue started. For whatever reason, the game would refuse to use my keyboard and mouse for input, despite not having any controller plugged in. I tried the next logical step (I'm looking at you Dark Souls), which was disabling any controller drivers on my computer. I still couldn't use my keyboard and mouse. So, I get frustrated once again and look online, where yet again people are encountering this issue. I then saw a YouTube video that gave a workaround; you have to plug in a controller (X-Input more than likely), start and close the game, and then start the game. This actually worked, however the method behind getting things to work is incredibly stupid; I have to plug a controller in to use a keyboard and mouse. Similar to Street Figher V's PC release, the graphics settings are good, if not great even, however the control options and screen options are pretty limiting. But unlike Street Fighter V, Resident Evil 7 is a complete game at launch, so I can actually recommend it for its gameplay. I will be happy to give this game a higher score if things are properly patched, however I think a 7/10 is the appropriate score for now. (If people want to know, I would have easily given this game an 8/10 if I didn't encounter these issues.)",Average

The fear factor is there, the graphics are very good, the story is weird in a positive way. The only downside I can think of is that the game is a bit too lineal, And sometimes a little bit too repetitive. A few friends of mine also told me the game isn't long enough and can be completed in like 10 hours. But these 10 hours are 10 hours of good time.

1908,resident-evil-7-biohazard,Z11,"Jan 31, 2017",8,"Resident Evil is back! This game is wonderful and I enjoyed every second of it. It goes back to the roots of the resident evil franchise where its slow paced and full of scary moments. There are no spoilers just what i thought was good and bad. Pros:1. There are scary moments in the game that made me jump,2. Combat is good. Weapons are nice.3. Story was quite interesting doesn't really follow the other games so you can pick this one up and play it.   4. Boss fights were a fun experience.5. fun puzzles to solve throughout the game6. Game looks amazing and did not crash once Cons:1. Game was not as long as i would've like for the 60 dollar price tag it took me about 7-8 hours to beat it and that was me checking every inch of the map.2. Final boss is kind of easy.3. Not too many enemy types in this game. There is technically 4 bosses in the game and about 3-4 different types of enemies.4. Too many jump scares Resident evil 7 is not the best game I've ever played but its a step in the right direction for the franchise. The game was a lot of fun and I couldn't stop playing. I do feel the price tag is high for the amount of content you are getting. The game does rely on a lot of jump scares but I feel that the environment, music and slow pace really helps the game. This is just my opinion and some might disagree but I feel this game is worth a try when it drops down in price i feel like 30 dollars is a good deal for this game. I hope the resident evil franchise sticks to this formula and keeps improving with every new installment.",Positive
1909,resident-evil-7-biohazard,Jripper93,"Jan 31, 2017",8,"Pros:+There are many nods to the classic Resident evil 1-3 in this game.+A step forward from re6, not backwards.+Ammo felt sparse in hardest difficulty giving that OS moment when they hand you a ton bullets and you know something nasty is around the corner.+Inventory space management is very similar to old resident evils. You have to decide which items stay in your inventory and what need to be saved in the classic themed ""safe rooms chests.""+Use of combining and examine was executed perfectly.+Plenty of panic moments to try to bait you into eating your bullets up.+Items were actually very well hidden, i'm sure without the a certain item in the game I would have missed some items hiding in dark corners. Maybe could have decreased the duration of those, and made them more rare as a craft only item so you have to waste potential items which could have been used on health/ammo so decision making is required. Cons:(-1 point) -Game was very short, but given the fact most of the time was spent working on a new framework, that is common in game development. Whichever comes first, I expect Re8 or Re2 Remake to be much longer using this framework. If the next game isn't longer, you'll get more than 1 point knocked off my review for that game. 17 hours should be how long i'm stuck on a single puzzle, not how long it takes to complete the game.(-1 point) - AI needs some major improvement. Monsters kept running into doors and got stuck in the corner allowing you to just go up and kill them without them moving. The second boss encounter required no skill at all and was not enjoyable for me. That cliche item should not have been usable in that boss fight. Make me waste my ammo and run out if i screw up instead. -WHERE'S THE TYPEWRITER? Typewriter was iconic and should have been used to be able to save. I'm sure most of the people playing this game have used one before and it doesn't need to be modernized to a tape recorder to appeal to younger audience.-No VR support.- Fix the lip sync, 144hz 1440p with adjusted settings caused audio desynch even when frames were optimal. Finally managed to fix with bloom settings.-Textures. The game looks really good in 1440p, but certain things were very noticeable when you used a low res door or a low res picture hanging in the hallway. Even the leaves on the stairs right, on the ground outside the 3dog looked bad to me. Give me a slider in the next game where I can adjust those setting.-Stagger. More stagger! What happened to trial and error on where the hit spot is on enemies?- Secrets were too easy and there weren't enough puzzles to make it challenging. When I think of RE I think, tough puzzles while danger lurks around the other corner. Not once did i have pressure to hide from an enemy while doing a puzzle.- Really felt like the hardest difficulty needed to be unlocked already and a middle ground between that and normal needed to exist. Overall, if you are a fan of the classic resident evils and need a game to beat over the weekend, this game is worth purchasing right away if you can't wait. I don't feel like it was worth $60 due to it's length, but didn't want to wait for a sale.",Positive

The game's one flaw is the one that everyone has been talking about: the lack of enemy variety.

1921,resident-evil-7-biohazard,Antioch,"Jan 27, 2017",8,"Despite my love for the old style games in this franchise and my suspiciouns about the changes I actually enjoyed this title.I have been dissapointed with RE ever since RE5 released. That game diluted the franchise, removed atmosphere and puzzles instead focuing on action. And then came RE6 wich was even worse and the god awful spinoffs.This game actually has atmosphere and again a throwback to playing smart and micromanage your inventory etc. It also modernised the combat and put you in a first person view although it is by no means a first person shooter.It is very different from previous RE titles and at times it seems this horror game is about the supernatural instead of the biological explanations that has always been there in RE games. Personally I'd prefer this game to be a spinoff of the main franchise rather than a numbered game in the franchise because it does differ ALOT from both those expecting something like the good old days RE1-4 and Code Veronica, and from those expecitng an action game like RE5-6. And I think alot of the dissapointment from the exaggerated scores of 0 and 1 comes from just that, it beeing to different from those games. And the tieins to the RE world and old games are very minor to be even worth mentioning.It is very similar to other horror titles available though. Particularly on pc, cues from the style of Amnesia and Outlast are obvious, only with combat added.  But make no mistake, on it's own it IS good. And had it not been a RE game alot of the same people trashing it now would score it alot higher. I enjoyed it enough to play through it three times. My first on normal, my second on madhouse wich had shifted around enemies and items and my third as a speedrun on easy. Making a different choice in two of the playthroughs to se both endings. My main issues with this game are not enough varied enemies, choices that really only result in a very slight difference to the story and gameplay, even the endings are very similar aswell and very little tie in to RE world and previous games for it to be a numbered game in the franchise. Performance wise on my trusted soon 4yo rig, i7 4770K, 16GB RAM and GTX TITAN Black it ran at locked 60fps at maxed out 1080p. No drops whatsoever, no bugs and no crashes. I'd like a few more pc options but overall I'm very happy with the pc version of this game. If you love games like outlast, amnesia etc. and are not tired of them this game is for you. It adds combat but otherwise works in the same vein. If you are more into RE5-6 style gameplay, more into action than setting and ""horror"" then this is not for you.",Positive

The plot isn't terribly deep, and the protagonist is forgettable, but what Resident Evil game is known for its deep and intricate plot? The gameplay is a nice mix of old and new, the modernized but slightly clunky controls recreate the feeling of days of old, only instead of using tank controls to create tension, it uses a limited field of vision and inaccurate aiming. Every enemy is a threat, even when there's only one of them. They never get de-valued. You never feel like some superhuman. They also kept the intricate environment exploration and unique puzzle solving, as well as adding unique and memorable villains, and at no point does the game feel like it's getting repetitive. People complain about how short it is, but the game lasts about 10 hours, and that's about the average length of any normal game.

They eventually pose no threat…The game would’ve greatly benefitted from sticking to the style of focusing on 1 unique characters per section of the game like the first half instead of throwing in these generic monsters around every corner to deal with…They broke the experience immersion for me and reminded me this was a video game..And the games reliance on these enemies is worse as it goes on that by time I was in the final 3 hour stretch of this 7 and a half hour game I was running through them and the rest of the game like it was nothing… thankfully the final 20 minutes or so bring the game back to what it does best…But these putty creatures plucked from the power rangers are a joke.They’re a slight hiccup in the overall fantastically horrifying experience that is resident evil 7 though…The game is so clever with its puzzles, even doing subtle things like putting solutions or important item locations in these vhs tapes where you play as other characters.. these vhs tapes are just as terrifying as the main game, if not more at times…And you never feel stuck… again I beat the game in 7 and a half hours and I was very thorough…the game does a great job of bread crumb trailing you to the right items you need..Resident Evil 7 is also compatible with the PlayStation vr... which im sure makes this game even more terrifying...unfortunately this does get in the way of the game itself for those of us not using vr as theres this weird directional audio thing going on where you have to look at a character to really hear what they’re saying…That isn’t how real life works and its annoying.. .So for better and for worse, this game was definitely developed with vr in mind… it wasn’t an afterthought or an added gimmick…Resident evil 7 stumbles at times stopping it from being crowned as a true masterpiece…But I can’t look over the moments that bring it so close to that status…I can’t look over the fact that im one of the most unphased by horror people I know.. And this game got to me.This is hands down the best horror games I’ve ever played…I Give Resident Evil 7 biohazarda 9.5/10",Positive
1931,resident-evil-7-biohazard,chipotlegasm,"Jan 25, 2017",10,"As a huge fan of Resident Evil 1 and Resident Evil 4, I have to say that Capcom did an incredible job bringing back the series to it's survival horror roots. While I am only 4 hours through the game, I will separate what I love from what I hated, and update the review further as I progress. *Pros - The game gives you the illusion of safety through high ammo counts, but as soon as Jack or the molded enemies appear, you go through ammo so fast without even realizing it, leading you to helplessly run or stand your ground, pull out your knife, and do it the old fashioned way. - Puzzles are back, and although most are not nearly as complex as previous examples, they are always satisfying to solve and never make you feel dumb or frustrated. - Jack, the ""daddy"" of the family, is one scary ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. He's relentless, and doesn't let up unless you cap him in the head a few times, or in the body multiple times. His dialogue is great, and sometimes even lessens the tension with his humor, before he smacks you with his shovel to get you serious again. He's unpredictable, and isn't just out to kill you, but taunt and toy with you as well. - Detail inside of the house is beautifully horrifying, from it's hallways covered in mold to it's dinner tables covered in entrails, the Baker house is always keeping you on the edge of your seat. - Plenty of collectibles to find during your journey, and some of them reward you greatly if you can find enough! Also, lockpicks are a big part in this game, but are very limited. So you need to pick and choose what you decide to unlock. You usually end up in a situation where there are 3 things you need to unlock, but you only have one lockpick. - PC optimization is great! Plenty of graphics options, uncapped framerate, Gsync support for the real enlightened PC gamers out there, as well as resolutions up to 4K and HBAO+ AO for Nvidia users. *Cons - Some character models kind of look odd. Something about Marguerite Baker in particular just looks out of place. Her face looks like shes had 500 plastic surgeries done and it's just ugly to look at. I'm not sure if that's what they were going for, but I wish it was a little better. - Sometimes it's just TOO ♥♥♥♥ing dark. Like I want to play on the recommended brightness, but it makes item discovery 10x harder when you can barely see. I don't know why the flashlight is something only the game can turn on instead of something you can turn on and off whenever you please. - There are some textures that really look awful. I thought the PC version would alleviate this, but a PC can only put as much effort in as the developers did. Still better on PC with high refresh rates, game runs like butter. Overall, I am totally LOVING this game so far. I think it's absolutely phenomenal and worth every penny. Please don't hold out and risk getting spoiled! If you're interested, buy it now. 5 hours in, Resident Evil VII is a clear 10/10 for me. Here's to hoping something further down the line won't ruin that for me.",Positive
1932,resident-evil-7-biohazard,BlackFaction,"Jan 25, 2017",10,"O renascimento da franquia que parecia perdida, enredo muito bem desenvolvido, terror e tensão a todo momento, lembra muito o estilo dos primeiros jogos da série, porém com visão em primeira pessoa, não é difícil e nem ruim de se acostumar com a nova jogabilidade, na verdade deixou o game bem mais aterrorizante e intenso porque você realmente se sente no lugar da personagem.",Positive
1933,resident-evil-7-biohazard,SofaTrooper,"Jan 25, 2017",9,"Resident Evil 7 takes from some of the best horror movies and places you right in the centre. There are clear influences of the classics, such as, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Blair Witch and The Exorcist. But also uses a lot of psychological tension to build atmosphere, with great sound design always leaving you on edge. I recommend this game to all horror fans. .",Positive
1934,resident-evil-7-biohazard,silver_lion,"Jan 25, 2017",9,"Awesome game! Very intense, I just wish it came to VR on PC sooner because this game would be a reason to give VR a shot. The graphics, atmosphere, sound are pretty damn good",Positive
1935,resident-evil-7-biohazard,Carbon_Coded,"Jan 24, 2017",10,Amazing. A great PC port as well as an amazing story means this game is an absolute success. Includes a free DLC as well. The whole thing was really a masterpiece.,Positive
1936,resident-evil-7-biohazard,Duperre,"Jan 24, 2017",10,The true fan will enjoy this. It's truly atmospheric and still engaging. I recommend you play the demo several times over. There is a multitude of endings and clearly shows a less linear path. You won't be disappointed with the results.,Positive
1937,resident-evil-7-biohazard,KingOfRock,"Jan 24, 2017",8,"This game is great. Great controls, great atmosphere, and a return to the classic RE survival horror style. You find yourself in a claustrophobic area with limited ammo or resources to survive, just the way it used to be and that's fantastic. While this isn't a perfect game, and certainly not the best Resident Evil ever, it's still a great game. I know there are some people out there who can't judge a game for what it is and instead hate it for what it's not, and that's pretty sad. You have to ignore the sense of entitlement from some gamers. I'm not sure why people want more of the same, especially since Resident Evil was going down the toilet for years. This is a great direction for the series. It isn't the first time Resident Evil went first person (that honor goes to ""Survivor"" on PS One), so it isn't like it's some bold new experiment. Just a step in the right direction the series desperately needed.",Positive
1938,resident-evil-7-biohazard,JovialTrash,"Jan 24, 2017",10,"Finally, Resident Evil is back! Resident Evil 7: Bioshock got this series back from the ""punching boulders""-action grave it's been stuck in for so long with a new perspective, great playability and a fantastic setting. This is exactly what the series needed.",Positive
1939,resident-evil-7-biohazard,veritas2884,"Jan 24, 2017",9,"What a fantastic rebirth for the series. When I played Resident Evil for the first time on Playstation all those years ago, I had the most immersive experience of horror I'd ever experienced. Since you're actually controlling the character, the horror produced by games always beat the most intense movie for me. Since RE:1 few games have recreated that level of dread. Outlast and Layers of Fear did great jobs of creating that same experience. However, they both had much smaller budgets than RE7. So Capcom has made a highly polished gem of horror and fear. They have created a game that is difficult but not unfair with a great plot and fun play mechanics. The fact that your character is not a special forces soldier or even a cop, means that you spend as much time hiding and planning your next move, as you do shooting or hacking at the enemy. Also, the relate-ability of the character to non-combat trained people adds to sense of fear through familiarity. The only thing that kept me from giving it a 10/10 is some of the boss battles didn't fit with the feeling and theme of the overall game.",Positive
1940,resident-evil-7-biohazard,Mhick,"Jan 24, 2017",9,"Haters gone Hate, O jogo está incrível, com excelente ambientação. Gráficos muito bons e otimizados, rodando a 60 fps em 1080p em todas as plataformas. O jogo tem elementos clássicos e ao mesmo tempo renova o jogo trazendo para o século 21. Não vão atrás dos HATERS e dos ""pseudo fãs"" saudosistas. RE7 é o retorno ao Survival horror! RE is Back.",Positive
1941,resident-evil-7-biohazard,nickr1407,"Jan 24, 2017",5,"I kind of liked it but I can't recommend it for $60. It's a breath of fresh air for the series but I think the game is a year or two late. It has a good atmosphere but so do a lot of  $15-$30 horror/walking games on Steam. It adds little new to the table besides an alright (kind of slow/clunky at times) combat system. Had it been $30 I'd say go for it.However I'd recommend the game to anyone who has yet to play a fps-horror game that game out in the last 3 years (Layers of Fear comes to mind although it doesn't have combat).",Average
1942,resident-evil-7-biohazard,vevo00,"Jan 24, 2017",10,"Otimo jogo , muito bem otimizado , não vá na onda dos haters , pois so jogo ta muito bom , historia , jogabilidade , a volta do terror com tudo nessa nova geração , finalmente um resident que presta .",Positive
